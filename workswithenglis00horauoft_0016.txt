turned back to them in all his after life.

The father of Horace, though of servile origin, was an
upright, intelligent man, and of a turn of mind that was
generous and truly noble; and whether from the workings of
his own impulses, or from his discernment in the boy of signs

of high promise, he early resolved to devote his time, his per- ¹

sonal efforts, and his slender resources, to the moral and intel-
lectual culture of his son. The first fruits of this noble
resolve were reaped by the poet, as he tells us himself,¹ in a
fine strain of filial pride, when, in his boyhood, perhaps about
twelve years of age, he had got beyond the first rudiments of

life, the writings of Livius, and indeed all the old Roman
poetry, were not at all to his taste.⁸ With Orbilius, or some
