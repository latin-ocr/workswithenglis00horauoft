i. e. my merit is a mere negative one. Osborne aptly quotes from
Pope‘s Essay οιι, Criticism .-

“ But in such lays as neither ebb nor now,
correctly eald, and regularly low,
Thai shunning saulis one quiet tenor keep,
We cannot blame indeed—but we may sloop.”

270. Halanos umeros et Sales· Here again, as in Epist. ii„ 1, 170,
Horace criticises Plautus. His severe taste was offended by the rough-
ness of his numbers and of his wit. It is singular that Cicero, on the
other hand speaks of Plautus as illustrating that “jocandi gemasss’
which he styles‘ ekgam, urbanum, ingeniosum, facetum. '² See De
