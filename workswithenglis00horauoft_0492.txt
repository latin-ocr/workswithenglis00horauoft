Orelli. —- lli-119. ler poet still speaks the sentiments of the Epi-
cureans. They allowed that man, by his constitution, could distinguish
between good and ill, what is desirable and what undesirable3 but not
between justice and injustice, right and wrong. The latter distinction
they founded in the usages of society. 115. Vincet ratio· Will rea-
scm tn‘umpltantl‘y preme. Vincere 2 evincere, to prevail over one’s oppo—
nent in argument3 in allusion to the efforts of the Stoics to carry their
dogma by force 01· reasoning.-——119. The sauciat was an ordinary
whip, the flagellum a frightful scourge, which Keightley compares with
the cat-o’-nim-tails. ——mo- Ut caedas—non vereor. Reisig (Lat. Gr.
p. 569) has best explained this construction, by supplying abad before
vereor,- ιο strike, etc, that I do not sear, etc. There is no need, there-
fore, of the supposition, that the poet wrote ut loosely, instead of ne.
— 126. Gur optas quod habes. These words must be joined 111 thought
with the clause above: si tibi regnum, etc. In asking 1113 question the
poet makes that si emphatic: You say {f men allow you to be king;
but if your sapiens is every thing, is king, if, in other words, you are
already king—why do you wislt for what you have ?—The Stoic idea of

shown, from the Tigellius, in Sat. -i., 2, 3. 13⁰. Alfenus· Orelli has

the poet uses in his raillery, as the Stoics were, as Dillenburger remarks,

at least semi cynici, κυνικόι, κυῶν. 137. quadrante. The fourth part
osan as, and the smallest piece of Roman coin. The public baths were

originally instituted for the poor, and were always intended chiefly sor
their convenience3 hence the low price, a quadrans. See Dict. Antiqq.
