he was said deserere vadimonium, ‘not ιο appemr, and lost the cane, οι·
forfeited the suin named in the bair—38. Μο- The long vowel
before amas is not elided, but shortened. See Z. ᾗ 9. -Δᾱοεο Adesse,
and, in next line, stare, or adstare, arc legal expressions, equivalent to
esse advocatus. An advocatas was an assistant in the conduct of a
cause; not to be consounded with our word advocate, which, in Latin,
is patronus. See Dict. Antiqq., under Advocalus. 48. Maecenas,
etc. These words, as far as omnes in l. 48, as Dillenburger explains,
must be ascribed to the troublesome companion of the poet, and the
whole is in admirable kccping with the vanity of the man's character.
44. Paucorum hominum3 sc. cst, belongs to few persons3 i. e.
keeps company with few persons ‚· is very select in his company. ·-—— 4⁶.
Dexterins3 i. e. of course than Maecenas, of whom he is talking. 11· the .
comparison applied to Horace, as some think, the pronoun would cer-
tainly be expressed—ffl. secundas3 sc. partes. The expression-is
borrowed from the stage—48. summosses· On the meaning of the

 

 

word, see n. O. ii., 16, 10. The pluperfect expresses the certainty of the
act, as if already donc. His potent aid once secured, the fancied rivals
are all cleared out of the way. —54. Quae tua virtus 3 :ea virtute,
qua, etc.; such is ‘your merit- See Arn. Pr. Intr„ 563 Z. ὖ 705. The

Posslt· For the subjunctive, see A. ἀ S. ᾗ 264, 5; Ζ. §x 555. The same
