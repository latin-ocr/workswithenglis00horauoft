derings, after much thought and discipline, something osa sense of
quiet and inward freedom, for which we are longing, and thch he cau
help us attain. We may gather up from his words the materials for
a philosophy of life, which is better as a practical guide than the specu-
lative systems of the poet’s time; more noble and elevating than the
Epicurean, more humane and humanizing than the Stoic; perhaps, in-
deed, the truest and the best, that the unaided wisdom of man cm
frame.

The poetical Epistle is a form of composition which Horace invented,
and in which, though often imitated, he has never been equalled. Most
of his imitatore, while they have not failed to perceive and to admito
that rare union of the utile and the dulce,* the instructive and the en-
tertaining‚ in which lies the secret of Horace⁷s power, have yet pressea
too far either the one or the other of these qualities‚ and so have
verged either to the dry and didactic, or to the low and trivial3 and even
Pope and Boileau‚ have, with ‘all their merit, fallen below the genial
excellence of their original. In that wonderful mingling of thoughtful
earnestness and playful humor, which, ever near together, and always
just in place, dignify and enliven one another, now pointing a sober pre-
cept with a sprightly jest, now drawing grave lessons from a gay table,
and, like the well attempered lights and shades of a fine picture, blend-
ing “severe truth '’ and “faery fletion'‘ into an harmonious whole,—
in that singular union of poet and philosopher, the man of wit and
genius with the man of sound sense and judgment, that we see every
where in the Epistles of Horace, he appears at once the inventor Μὰ
the unrivalled master of this species of composition.

Finally, it is worthy of remark, in this brief estimato os these writ-
ings‚ that, while they are the most original and thermost perfect of the
works of Horace, they are also the most characteristic of all the pro-
ductions of the Roman Muse. They are the genuine poetry of the Ro-
man lif'e3 they embody in a most finished poetic form, those qualities of
the national character, that for long centuries were at once the glory
and the safety of Rome. That strong practical sense, that earnestness
and love of order, those virtues of temperance, frugality‚ moderation,
self-government, which mark and set apart the Roman stom all other
types of ancient character,—all these have found, in the Epistles οἵ
Horace, a just and poetic expression. There, while we see as in a
mir-ror, the image of a Roman poet—if not the most gisted of the poeta
of Rome, certainly the poet of largest experience‚ both in life and in
art, and of incomparably the greatest influence‚—we also behold the
noblest and tmest reflection of the Roman spirit and character.
