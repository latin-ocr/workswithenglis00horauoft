expression Mauri peditis is equivalent (as Dillenburger gives it) to
Mauri equo dejecti, the vultorsed or dismoumed Mauretaniam.. The im-
age is that of a Mauretanian thrown from his horse, and turning with

sorty years of age. The word juvenis might be used of any one be-
tween twenty and forty. An adolescens was, strictly speaking, younger
’ than a jamnis,- the former word being used of persons, between fisteen
and thirty. But the usage, in respect to both these words, was not uni-
rormly obsewed, even by the best prose writers. 42. Ales· J oin

ODE III.

ln this ode, Horace, having first charged the ship, in which his friend Vix-gil had em-
berked sor Athens, to bear its precious steight in safety ιο the place of destination, dwells
with a poevs kindled imagination upon the daring os those who first braved the petiis
os the sea, and thence pasees ιο general inusti-atinus os the presumptuous boldnees os
um human tace.

We leam from Virgil’s Life, written by Donatus, that that poet, in the year os Reme
7³5, went ω Greeee with the intention os remaining nbroed three years, but that, on his ar-
rival at Athens, meeting with Augustus, who was going back to Rome from the East, he
determined ω return with him; and that while on his way home he was taken ill, and
fimuy died at Brundusium, on the md day of September.

1. Sic, etc. Sic, in forms of petition, implies some condition, and
iszlwae conditiora, thus: if—on condition that—you do so or so, may
this or that befall you. Here the condition is found in the last two

tion will appear, in translation, by beginning with Navis—meae, and
ending with Sic—Iapyga.-—Petens (typri. Venus; see n. Ο. ἱ., 30, 1.
