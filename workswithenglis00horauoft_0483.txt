Wx are indebted to the Romans both for the word Satire, and tho
species of composition which it designates. We find, however, that in
the progr-ess of Roman literature, both these underwent important
changes. The word Satwra, which properly means the same as farra·
go, a mixture of various things, was applied, at a very early period,
to a kind of composition, which treated discursively of various suh-
jecta, partly in prose, and partly in poetry, and, in the poeticsl parm,
in verses of different measures. From a passage in Livy‚* which is'the
prIncipal authority on this point, it would also appear that this early
&bum was a rude kind of drama, partly extemporaneous and partly
written, which developed no regular plot, and in its broad burlesque
resembled the †Fescennine verses of the ancient people of Italy. 'rho
satires os Ennius and Pacuvius, though perhaps not dramatic, were, at
kas-t in their mixed and irregular character, examples of the ancient
Satura.

In later times, aster the regular drama had been introduced by Livi-
us Andronicus, there arose the Satira or Satire, which, though not in-
tended for the stage, yet in its aim to represent life, and in its adoption
of something of the form of dialogue, shared some of the characteris-
tia of the older Sauara. Lucilius is mentioned by Quintilian as the
first who gained distinction in this kind of writing, and he may be just-
ly pronounced its inventor. He wrote in hexameter verse3 and took
the material of his satire from the whole range or hmnan lise, its
illustrations of good and evil, of virtue aud of vice, of wisdom and of
folly.

It is this kind ot· satire, which, both in its form and its subject-
matter, these writings of Horace illustrate. His Satires are sketehes of
lire and manners, of the lire and manners of the Romans, in the reign of
Augustus. His own words in several passages help us to indicate the
