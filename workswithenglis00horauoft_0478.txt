EPODE XVII.

The poet ridicules, with bitter satire, Canidia and her sorceries. Affecting to meant,
as is himself her vicdm, what he had before written (in Epode Fisth), he really repeat:
it all, and adds yet more ; and in the words os reply which he puts into her mouth, make·
her criminate and ridicule herself.

compare the Fisth Epode‚ together with the introduction.

8. Dianae· Hecate, as in Epod. ὁ, 51. -4. car-1111· Forma, in
verse, of charms and incantations. -7- Tui-binen- The magieal
wheel, which, as it went round, involved the victim more and more in
the wiles of the sorceress, and when turned back released him.—
8. Nepotem Nereiu· Achilles, who at length bened, by the rust of
his spear, the wound he had inflicted upon Telephus. —u- Hector*
The idea is by implication, that the body of Hector was restored by
Achilles, who could not resist the supplications of Priam. —n- VO-
lente circa. So Circe, moved by the prayers of Ulysses, freed the vio-
tims of her somnes—2⁰. Amata, etc. Of course, in irony. As an
old Scholiast says, urbanissima contumelia—22· Lurlda· When the
body is wasted, and shows nothing but skin and bones—25· urget
(ilem, etc. Compare the poet’s lauguage in O. ii., 18, lsi—Est, like
{our-licet. And Ι may not. So Tacitus, Germ. 5, Est videre—vasa.
—28- Sabella· So in Sat. i.‚ ,9, 29, Sabella—cecinit anus. Τὶιθ people
seem to have been versed in magio arts. —290 Harsa. As in Epod.
5, 76, the Marsi are here represented as excelling in magio incantations.
.-31. Hercules. See note, Epod. 3, 17. -33, virens. This is the
reading of the most MSS., and is adopted by nearly all the Editors; it
is interpreted as referring to the color of sulphur flame, which Orelli
describes as something “between light yellow, green, and blue.”—
25. omn-,inu with tm you like a workslwp.-—36. runs. On tho
gender, see note, Ο. ii., 18, 30.—36. Stipendium. This word, as it
means in general, what one has to pay, is used here in the sense of poena.
——w- mendaci lyra. A refinement of irony and satire. In the same
breath that he promises to sing her praises, he pronounces his lyre
mendacibus—42. Infamls; desamed; by Stesichorus (vati, 1. 44).

,γ Tm story was, that the poet was punished by Castor and Pollux. with

blindness for slandering Helen, and was afterwards cured by them,
on his writing arecantation.—42· Vlcem. On account of Helen. On
the construction with offensus, see Z. §453—48. obsoleta. Pol-
hoted. The negative only makes more forcible the poet’s allusion
