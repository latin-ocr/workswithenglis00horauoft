> It is unneeesssry to dwell st length upon the litei-ary
merite of ι writer, whose fame has long been permanently
established, md “ whom au men admire in proportion to their
enpaoity for appreciating him.” The versatility of the genius
of Homo is shown by the various depertments of poetry,
which he cultivated· 1n all of whioh he was eminent, in some
original md unequslled. It was his own δοιιειι,ι that he had
tenetls 1n his odes, the peculisi· und enduring monument of
his fune· , and certainly his lyrie oomposifions, though not the
most vslusble and popular of his vorke, yet best exhibit his
distinotively poetic powers. If they do not indicate the pre-
senoe of the highest attributes of genius, they display s rare
assemblage of the gifts and attainments of a. true poet ; s
lively and well-stored fancy, an exquisite sensibility‚ delicate
peroeptions, a faultless teste, with a mastery of the greces and
powers of metre and of langmge, harmony of numbers, ele-
gmoe and vigor of style, and a felicity of expression² which
ns von and een be won only by the most assiduous culture.
The claims of Horace to originality as a lyrie poet have
been much diseussed, and his odes have been characterized,
sometimes in an ambiguous and very often in a direetly dis-
’ paraging tone, as imitatione of the lyrie poets of Greeee. It
is sn obvious fact, that the meti-es of his odes are Greek, and
the fullest admission of the fact is of oourse no disparagement
to his originality3 he boasted himself thst he had been the
first to transfer to the Roman lyre the Aeolian mensures,⁸
and well he might be proud that he had so skilfully adapted
those graeeful and flowing mensures to his inflexible native
tangue. In other respeets, in all that is essential to the char-
acter of the odes, it is diffieult ιο determine, in the absence of
direct evidence, how far and in what sense he was sn imitator.
