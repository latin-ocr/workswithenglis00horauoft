SATIRE H.

The poetatirizes the oendency os men to run from one extreme ω another. 'nub
tendency is staoed directly in vome 24; aud iu the remainder os the satire it is illunnud
α by different forms os licentiousnees, then prevailing at Rome.

1. Ambubaia‘run. Syrian female musicians, notoriously immoraL
who frequented the Circus and other places of resort. Juvenal also
alludes to them in Sat. 3, 62-65.—T11e word itself is from the syriace-
The word collegia is added in jest, as if these girls formed regular asso-
ciations, like the collegia pontificum, augurum, and others—Pht!-
neopum. Pedler quacks. Cicero refers to such a one in pro Cluentio,
14.—2. mendici. Mendicants,· e. g. the priests of Isis and Cybele,
who carried about an imag'e of their deity, and begged alms; perhaps,
too, the Jews, to whom also Juvenal osten assudes, especially in Sat. 6,
543. *ΠΙ-ιο. Female pantomimae players ; who acted in a kind of
farne, generally low and indecent. In the regular drama, both Greek
and Roman, women never played. —Balatrom- Buffoems. Festus
derives the word from blateae, clots of mud cleaving to one's shoes or
clothes aster a journey. OreUi adds in explanation, “ as mud to the
shoes, so these buffoons stick to the rich.'’— 8. Tigelli. Tigellius, a
celebrated musician of the time, a native of Sardinia, a favorite of Julius
Caesar and of Augustus. He was popular with the classes just before
mentioned, because he was always ready to lavish his money upon
them. —4. meg this one; some one of a character, the opposite of
that of Tigelius.—7. Bue- still another person—8· stringat.
He wastes ,· literally strips off, the metaphor being taken from stripping
the leaves of a tree. 13. This line also occurs in Ars. P. 421.—
14. quinas—mercedes. Mercedes means here interest on capital. The
legal rate of interest at the close of the Republic, and under the Empe-
ποτε, was twelve per cent. or one per cent. a month; usually called cen-

 

tesima, because at this rate in a hundred months a sum was paid, equa}
to the principal. This usurer cuts out, deducts five times the regular
interest from the principat, capiti, i. e. gets sixty per cent. for his eapi-
tal. —180 Sumpta—virili. Usually at the age of sevenoeen years.
—1·1. sub patribus duris. Boys under such strict care would be iu
need of money, and such as had expectations could readily get it, though
at enci-mous rates of interest, from the usurers. By the Roman law,
persons under twenty-five were minors. and by the lez Plaetoria, fraud-
ulent contracte with such were set aside, and the fraudulent· party held
liable to heavy penalties. The risk incurred, the usurers took well into
the account in their rates of interest, when they lent money to minora.
