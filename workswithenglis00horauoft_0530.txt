Imm-inat, etc. See last sentence of the Introd. ——400 sepa-us, etc.
This must of course mean nearly seven years; litei-any, the seventh‚
nearer the eighth ; i. e. towards the end of the seventh, and the begin·
ning of the eighth, year. It is difficult to see, how Orelli and othen
can make the words mean—“ nearly eigld years.’'—The subj. sugent
gives the assertion an easy, familiar air: may Ιιαυε passed away. — 44.
Threx—par. Gallina, the name of a gladiator; called Threx, because
he used the Thracian weapom, viz. a small round buekler‚ and a short
dagger, sica. With a Threx was usually matched a mirmillo—suehm
probably Syrus‚—so called from the image of a fish, μορμύρος, worn on
the helmet. The mirmillo had Gallie weapons.—-47· Sthjeeflu'} οῦ.

55. Trlqnetra, i. e. Sicily.— 63. Pythagorae cognata. Perhaps, as the
Scholiast suggests, a playful allusion to the fact, that Pythagoras pro-
hibited his followers from the use of beans, on the ground of his doo-
trine of the transmigration of souls3 that the soul of one of the phi-
losopher’s own relatives might pass into a bean! But cicero (de niv.
Ι. 30) explains the prohibition differently. 64. uncta sans. ‚These
two words belong together. — 65. 0 noctes, etc. Noctes because the
coemoe were protracted till deep in the night. The poet has in mind the
happy and ordinary gatherings of himself and his neighbors3 such as
Cato describes in Cicero’s De Senectute, c. 14.—-a¹1. uhtiug temper-
anter degustatis, ⁰f which we laad moderately tasted. In this explanation
I follow Orelli, who, in rejecting the idea of libation, attached by some
to the expression, says that libare in that sense is used only of wine.
The words in Liv.xxxix., 43, libare diis dapes, are not conclusive, as
both pocula and epulae are mentioned in the sentence. — 69. ΙΛςΙὶΙε
Ιιιειιιίες i. e. those imposed by the magister convivii at a banquet in the

Z. §4⁰5- For acts os hospitality. So Orelli and Dillenburger, and I
think, correetly. Other Editors make hospitiis the abl. Orelli compares
Juvenal iv. 67, propera stomachum laxare saginis. — 84. Invidit
avenae. Avenae, genitive. Usually it is invidere alicui aliquam rem, as
Sat. i., 6, 50 '; but sometimes, as here, in imitation of the Greek, alicuju
rei. See Krligerx') 358, A. 13 Z. 5413. — 87. Hale- Scarcely. Comp. n,
