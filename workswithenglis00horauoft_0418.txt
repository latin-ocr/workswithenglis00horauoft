ODE IV.

Horace, m this ode, celebrates his own good fortune aa a favente of the Museo, md,

ascribing a similar fortune to Augustus, laude the majesty os his person, md the 'baum
and moderatiori os his govemment.

Under the guardian care os the Muses the poet is protected in timo of peril, and i·
always and every where secure (1-36). The same protection and securitym enioyod by
Caesar, who loves ιο turn from the toils os war ω resreshing converse withmannus
(37-40). The wisdom the Muses inspire—the wiodom of a cultivated and well-ordered
mind—is superior ιο mere brute soree, and calmly triumpha overall ite rude violence.

The supremacy os such wisdom is illustrated by the victorias os Jupiter over the Ginaia
and Titane (41-80).

ln the illustrations drawn from the Titane and Giants, the poet probably designed ω
represent the wise and moderate rule of Augustus, aud his victorias over all his emin.

⁶. Amabills insania. Pleasingsrenzy. Insania is the fwror poeticus,
ἐνθουσιασμός, the “fine frenzy” of Shakspeare; under whose influenoe
the poet already hears the Muse responding to his call, and ie trans-
ported to the sacred groves she loves to haunt. —o- Feb-losne- Join
with palumbes,- and see n. Ο. i.‚. 22, 7. Horace seems to have had in
mind similar stories that were told of other poets, Pindar, Stesichorus,
Aeschylus, and Anacreon; also of Plato. So too, Homer, Od. 12, 62,
represents the doves bringing ambrosia to the infant Jupiter. ——vll-
turc ln Apulo. The Mons Vultur, now Monte Vulture, was in Apulia,
but its southern declivity stretched into Lucania⁷ so that the poet might
say extra limen Avuliae. Observe the variation in quantity here3 Apa-
ιο, Apuliae. There are many such instances in proper namen—14·

sition, perched like a mest, high up on the Vultur. So Cicero: Ithacam
illam in asperrimis saxulis tanquam nidulum affixam, de Orat. 1, 44.
Lower down was Bantia, now Abbazia di Vanzo, and at the base of the
hill was Forentum, now Forenza. All these towns were near Venusia,
the poet‘s birth-place. — 1¹1. lit—dormirem. Dependent upon mmm,
