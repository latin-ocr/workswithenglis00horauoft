These school—years of the future poet fell in one of the
most eventful periods of Roman history; and doubtless many
‘a day, as, by his father’s side, he hastened along the streets
to his usual tasks, or sat over his books under the uplifted rod
of the stern Orbilius, his eyes and ears were rudely greeted,
and his studies were suddenly broken up by the fierce soenes
and tumults of political excitement. For it was then that the
contest was raging between Caesar and Pompey3 it was the

At about the age of twenty, Horace went to Athens, which
held nearly the same relation to the Romans of that time, as
the German universities do to us, We may easily imagine with
what eager delight the young scholar hastened to that ancient
seat of the Muses, where yet lingered, long after the loss of
freedom, the lights of learning and the arts, with what enthu-

taught him to reverence as the cherished home of genius,
where every spot on which he gazed and the very air he breathed
awoke in his breast the glorious memories of poets, oratore,
*and philosopher& Of the studies he there pursued, under the
inspiring influence of the genius of the place, we have to gather
our knowledge partly from a few direct words, but chiefly from
scattered hints and intimations in his works. Speculative
inquiries could hardly fail to have some attractions for the
young student in a city, where philosophy had, in a former age,
employed in her service the greatest intellects the world has
known, and had ever since engaged the ablest minds of every
generation. In quest of truth, as we learn from himself, he
resorted to the Academy 3¹ and in those quiet groves where
