All-powersul is gold. Not brazen nowers, nor doors of σιξ, are proof against it; nor

1. Danaen turris. Τὴε story was told of Danae, that she was shut
up by her father, Acrisius, king of Argos, through sear of the oracular
prophecy‚ that his daughter was to bear a son, through whose agency
he would lose his life. —See Class. Dict — 3. Tristes 3=severae‚ sta-iet.

Auguris. Amphiaraus, whose death, as well as that of his son Alcmaeon,
was owing to the fatal bribe, the golden collar of Harmonia, by which
his wife Eriphyle was induced by Polynices to persuade her husband to
march against Thebes. See Class. Dict. —— 14. Vir Macedo. “The
man of Macedon;'’ Philip, of whom Cic. says, ad Att. 1, 16: Omnia
castella expugnari posse dicebat, in quae modo asellus auro onustus ascert-
dere possea—le. Duces· Orelli and Dillenburger illustrate this by

. the instance of Menas, the freedman of Pompey the Great, who was
commander of Sextus Pompey's fleet, then was bought over by Octavi-
an, and asterwards abandoned him, and went back to Pompey.-——2o.
unitu deeus. Horace uses here this mode of address, in allusion to
Maecenas's preference to remain in the humble equestrian rank in which
he was born. Comp. Ο. i.‚ 20, 65. —220 Famt sorte beatior. A con-
struction more common in Greek than in Latin. Fallere is joined with
a participle in the same way as is the Greek λανθάνειν, where it means,
to escape tlte notice of, to be unperceived by. In that sense it is also follow-
ed by an acc„ as here, fulgentem. Beatior is used like a participle, as
above, l. 25, splendidior, like the Greek adJective with ὅν, though the
corresponding verb esse happens to have no participia] form, and hence
it is wanting in these expressions. Beabus, too, here means rendering
me happy, beatior, rendering me more happy, as in Epist. i.‚ 10, 14; Ο. ἰ.,
29,1; ii., 6, 21. It only remains to be added, that fallit and beatior
agree with the preceding subjecta, fides—silva—n'vus, all of which ex-
press together the poet’s farm, agellus, as Dinenb. has it, or praedium.
