Extract from tlte Presace.

The present work is what its title indies-ties, strictly {ui Olkndorff, and aimsto apply tha
mothods which have proved so successful in the acquisit-ion of the Modern languages to tho
midy of Ancient Greek, with such differcnces of coume as the different euius of the Greek,
and tlie different purposes sor which it isflstudiem would suggest. It diflgrs from the modom
Ollondorffi in containing Exercises for recipi-ocal translation, in confining them within a tinniet
mm and in a inore methodica] exposition of the principles of the language.

lt ers. on the other hand, from other excellent elementa works in Greek, which have
nceptly ιςεαιηᾱ. in anmore rigid adherence to the Ollendo malind, and the greater eim-

ct of plim- in simplifying as much as possible the character of the Exercises} and in
meungnout of sight every thing which would divert the student’s attention from tho ria

The objectos the *Authoi- in this work was twofold; first, to furnish a book which should
αξξ sffiss’fflfflzt‘sf’&⁰13⁰ssaiffissgfflsskzaessmzzffffiisssssse ηᾛῑῖῗέἕιῗιιῗῖᾙωέἷὲῗέ
complete in mels, and wil lead the pupil, b insensible anons, from the simplet con·
stmctions to those which are more· complicateXand difficult.

The exceptions, and the more idiomatic soi-ins, it studiously leaves one side, and only ainis
to exhibit the regular and ordinary usages os the language, as the proper starting point for the
student’s further researches.

ln presentiiig these, the Author has aimed to combine the strictest accuracy with the utmost
simplicity of'statement. He hopes, therefore, that his work will find its way timong ii younger
class of pupils than have usualiy engaged in the study .⁰f Greek, and Will wm to the acquisi-
tion of that noble tonvue many iii oui· Academias and Primary schools, who have been re ned
by the loss simple character of oui· ordinary text-books: . Qu this potnt he would spes. eer-
nestly. This book, while he trusts it will beai· the criticism of the scholar, and be found
adapted to older pupils, has been yet constructed with a constant reference to the wants of the
young; and he knows uo reason why boys and girls of twelve, ten, or even eight years of eze,
may not advantageously be put to thu stwdy of this book, and, under skilsul instruction, rapidly
master its contenis.
