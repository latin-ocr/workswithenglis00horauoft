ODE VIII.

Under the veil of Grecian names, the poet presents the picture of a Roman youth,
abandoning for the fascinatione os love the manly sports of the Campus Martius.

exercises. Horace here touches upon some of the sports which made

tected by Ulysses (who was there selling wares as a pedler), from the
fact of Achilles selecting arms for purchase.
