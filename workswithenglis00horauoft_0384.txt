ODE XXVIII.

There is ,a diversity os opinion respecting the form and the divisione of tlu- ode. But
the pronouns te and me, in the connection in which they occur, make it sufficienuy clear,
that the sorm is a dialogue; and we gather from the word nauata in line 2³, and from Ar-
chytas in line 2, together with the request in lines 24 and 25, that the two parties are the
ahade os Archytas and a mariner.

Τὴο first twenty lines are the words os the mariner. Chaneing to discover, on the

coast os Apulia, the unburied corpse os the shipwrecked Archytas, he addreoeoe the quon—
dam philosopher, and tells him with something os raillery in his words, that not even he,
with all his attainments in sciense, could escape death, the common lot of mem that, in
spite os his lossy expectatione as a disciple os Pythagoras, he was now &nied a mansium
to the other world, and confined to the Matinian shore, simply sor the wem of a little
earth sor the decent burial os his body. With the words Me quoque. l. 21, the tmhappy
shade replies to the manner, assenting to the stem truth οἰ all his words, md prayhg
him to vouchsase the last offices to his unburied corpse.

Some make Archytas reply from line 7, and others srom line 1⁷3 but the words ,iudice
te cannot well be ascribed to Archytas; and tho lfith and l7th lines are eo closely connect·
ed, that they must be ascribed to the same person.

The ode teaches the trum, that death comes alike to au, the wiso md the simple, the
learned and the ignorant3 none are exempt. For the modern reader, it ium-ates the
strength and prevalence among the ancients‚ os the sentiment os respect sor the rim os
buria1; a sentiment finely illustrated by Sophocles’s tragedy os Antigone.

2. Archyta. Archytas of Tarentum was a Pythagorean philosopher,
a friend and teacher of Plato, and was distinguished for his attainmenm
in geometry and astronomy. To these attainments allusion is mdo in
line 1, and lines 5, 6. He was shipwrecked and drowned, while on a
yoyage, in the Hadriatic sea. --- 3. Parva masteng i. e. adhuc tibi

flit about the body, or wander along the banks of the Styx. —Hatlnl-·
