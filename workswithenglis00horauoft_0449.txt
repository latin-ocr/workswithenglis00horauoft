Sacra Via, the steep Clivus, leading from the top of the Velian ridge
which joins on to the Palatine (and on which now stands the Arch of
Titus), down to the southeastern angle of the Forum. The ancient
pavement of this part of the Sacred Way is still visible. Along this Clivus
passed the triumphal processions on their way to the capitol. The Sam
Clivus is sometimes confounded with the Clivus Capitolinus, which was
the ascent leading from the other extremity of the Sacred Way up the
Capitoline hilL To the Sacer Clivus Horace also alludes in Epod. 7, 7:
