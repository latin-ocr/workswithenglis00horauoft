NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ EPISTLES.

——.

Tus Epistles of Horace, the latest of his works, are the maturent
stuits of his litei-ary studies and culture, and of his observation and
experienoe of human life. In the form of familiar communicationis to
persona] friends, they disclose to us the interior of the poet's mind md
heart, and the life of thought and feeling. that flowed on there in even
current, in the last and best years of his life. It is this subjective cha·-
mter, that distinguishes the Epistles of Horace from his Satires. In
his Satires, the poet contemplates the life that was going on without
and around him; he paints the manners of men and of the times, as he
saw and caught them, as they rose in the living world of Rome; and,
even in the few places where he dwells upon himself, his starting point
is in something external, in some opinions of other men, and generally
in their envious judgments of his habits and character. But in the
Epistles‚ the point of departure, if we may so say, is the poet’s self;
they reveal to us his own individuality; they tell us in easy converse,
and yet in finished verse, his own habitual thoughts and sentimenta,
whether on art, poetry, philosophy or letters3 his most cherished
wishes and tastes, his experiences of the world, and what they have
taught him, and all the way in which he is wont to vienn, to under·
stand, and to enjoy human life.

gives them their interest and their value, which has drawn and fastened
to them so many minds and hem-ts, and ever instructed and delighted
them. They teach us, from out ⁴the poet’s own experience, so many
Iessons of good sense, moderatiori and wisdom‚ fitted to the conduct of
our own every-day lives3 which chat-m us by their serene humor and
graoeful diction, and win us by their humane and friendly tone. We
feel ourselves in communion with an earnest‚ tranquil, and yet genitu,
happy spirit, that has practieally learned what we too need to know;
that has found out much, at least, of the secret of human lise, and
knows how to impu-t it to othei-⁵3 that has reached, atter many wan·
