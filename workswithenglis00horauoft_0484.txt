particular style of satire-in which he chose to write.. In the rirat Satin
of the First Book, he pleasantly inquires:

 

“quanquam ridentem dicere verum
Quid vetat ’μ’

And in the Tenth of the same Book he says—

“Ridiculum acri
Fortius et melius plerumque secat res.”

In a word, it is the playful style of Satire, that which employs all the
gentle arts of humor and raillery‚ in which Horace wrote, and in which
he excelled. His satirical writings present a striking contrast to those
of Juvenal, the master of grave. severe satire-3 and the contrast between
these two satirists is easily explained by the difference of their persona}
character and of the times in which they lived. Horace was a man of
genial temper and easy habit? a wise and well-bred man of the world;
and living in a time when there yet lingered something of honor aud
virtue in the luxui-icus life of Rome, he could make merry with the
follies and even the vices of men. But Juvenal was a man of uncom-
mon gravity and earnestuess of character, and lived in a later and
utterly corrupt age; and he came forth among his countrymen like an
inspired prophet, arrayed in awful dignity, and scourged their wicked-
ness with unrelenting severity.

We find imitations of Horace's style of satirizing iu various modern
writers especially in Pope and Swift in English, and Boileau iu French
literature. Some of these imitations will be alluded to in the notes
that follow.
