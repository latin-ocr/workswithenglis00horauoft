omi* XXXV.

'ssus poet invokcs roi-tune as an all-powersul goddosu (1-4>; whose favor all solicit,
whose smwn all sear (5-16); who centron, however, the affairs os men, no't⁷ by a blind

caprice, but by sure and unchangeable laws (17-m); whom Hope and Fidelity ever at-
tend and honor oel-aen hc implores her ιο preserve Augustus in his distant expedition.
and ω ειη the state from ruinous and detesmble civil ware (ae-end).

lt will be secu that lt is not the Greek Τύχη whom the poet invokes3 a caprieious, ar-
hin-m deity, such as is described in the preceding ode, and inode 2921: os Book Third3 but
the Forum os the ancient ltaliam, as she was conceived os and worshipped at Antium,
Praeneste, and other Latin towns.

'rho ode was probably written s. c. 27, the year in which Augustus ordered the Arabim
expediam referred ω in introductioni to ode 29th; and in which, too, Augustus is said ιο
have modinoed an invasion os Britain.

1. Anum The capital of the Volsci in Latium, where was a cele-
bratcd temple of Fonuna; its site was near the modern Porto d’ Anzo.
——2. Praesens· Used in the sense of potens, able. Dillenb. refers in
illustration, to o.1ii., 5, 2; Sat. ii., 3, 68; Epist. ii., 1, 1343 also Cic.
Tuse. i., 12, 28.-—4. Funeribus· Abl. instead of in funera„- a singu·
lar construction, of which we have only one other instance, in Ars. P.
226 ; perhaps used by the poet, on account of the resemblance in meaning
to the verb mutare. — 6. Buris colonus· Ruris depends upon colonus,
not, as some have it, upon dminam; its place is conclusive on this
point. But colo-nus does not simply mean husbandman (agricola or rus-
ticus), but one hired to cultivate the soil, a tenant-comp. Ο. ii.⁷ 14,

This word, in particular, was used, perhaps, on account of the commerce
between Bithynia and Rome 3 or because the ship was made of timber

O. iii„ 24, 9.- 14. Stantem columnam. »Stans columna is metaphor-
ical for a firm and secure government. The words neu. populus, ete, il-
lustrate what has gone before, showing the way in which the peace of
the state may be invaded; and the repetition of ad arma brings, as it
were, to our ears the repeated shouts of a tumultuous assemblage of
people.— 1¹1. Saeva Necessitas.. All the objects which Horace here
brings together in this description of Necessity, are emblematic of
strength and timess, and thus illustrate her invineible might. Herder
very happily conjectured, that the poet’s description was suggested by
some painting or statue of N ecessity, which was in the temple at Anti-
um.—-—-2l· '1⁸0 spes, etc. In deseribing Hope and Fidelity‚ as the
never-failing companions of Fortune‚ the poet means to mach, that the
