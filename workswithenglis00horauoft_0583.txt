agrees spem—longam in Ο. i., 4, 15, where see n. In this meaning, too,
the expression well follows ditant—Coma Cic de Senec. 7. Nemo

Forcellini, who explains, “ tardus et difficilis ad sperandum ;” and they
cite Aristotle’s δυσέλπιδες. Avidus. This is the mding of all the

eloquent narrative of one who was present, viz., at the scene which he

Gorn- pop-lq as in the tragedy of Medea ascribed to Seneca; but in
γ Euripides the action takes place elsewhere, and is related by the
ἅγγελος οι· messenger; and so in general, in the Greek tragedias, such
soenes are narrated, not acted. The modern drama, on the contrary, is
not always in accordance with the precept of Horace, as, for instance,
Shakspeare’s plays, in which deaths and murders are so often repre-
sented. — 189. Qui-w netu. The rule to have Just five acts was strictly
observed by the Roman dramatists. ΤΙιθ Greek tragedies had three
parts, the πρόλογος, the ἐπεισόδια, and the ἔξοδος. Where the episodes
were three in number, the play thus had five parts, correspond'mg to
the five Roman actus ,· but there was no fixed number of episodes.—
Orelli. Without doubt (as Orelli suggests) the Roman actus were
modelled upon those parts of the Greek tragedy. In modern literature,
the French and the Italian drama each observes Horaoe's rule; so, too,
in their master-pieces‚ the English and the German. —191. Dignus
vindice nodus. Nudus, literally knot, is the,complicated difficulty of
a play, the intr-igue ,- vindex, avenger, rescuer, here one who can develop
or unravel the intrigue, bring about the denmaemenc. A writer, lacking
invention. would be apt, in the catastrophe of the play, to have re-
course to the supernatural, and rescae his hero by the interposition os
a god, hence the necessity of this rule of Horace. Euripides osten
availed himself of such means in the denmaenmw of his plots.—-Comp.
