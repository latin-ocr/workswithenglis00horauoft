This feature of primitive life, Horace seems to have bon-owed from
Caesar's account of the Suevi, B. G. 4, 1: Centum pagos hahere dicim-
twr, e quibus quotannis singida millia armatorum bellandi causa camut.

29, sortes creantur fortibus ethonis. Plautus has also an illustrative pas-
sage, which is quoted by Orelli and Dillenb.: it is in Amphit. ii.‚ 2, 207:
Non ego illam dotem mi esse duco, quae dos dicitur ,- sed pudicitiam ά pu-
dorem εε sedatam cupidinem, Deam metum, parentam amorem, et cognatam
concordiam—The form parentium occurs very seldom, though similar
ones are found, even in prose, e. g. civitatium. 24. Et peccare· With
this line, illic (l. 17) must be repeated. Peccare refers to violation of
castitas. Aut-:alioquim else, is otherwise. To commit (that offenoe) is
(deemed) the utmost widi-edoma or else (that is, if the offence is commit-
ted), tlte penalty is death. —w- civicam· See n. Ο. ii.‚ 1, 1.-—-2¹7.
Pater urbium. The poet probably alludes to ‘Augustus Comp intmd.
to Ode 6th of this Book. The words, however, arc not a title of Augus-
tus, nor to be eonfounded with paler patriae. See n. Ο. i.‚ 2, 50.—

Repeat the si from l. 36. Opprobrinm is in apposition with pomeria.
46. 'rurba faventium. Such donations were solemnly deposited in
the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, amidst the applauding shouts of the
people. Favere is osten used in the sense of applaud. So Livy, 1, 25,
clamore, qualis—faventium solet. 5⁷. Graeco· Used in contemptu aa
the Roman sports were more manly and healthful. So Juvenal, with
yet more reason, satirizes the adoption of Grecian mamers, in sat. 8, 67:
