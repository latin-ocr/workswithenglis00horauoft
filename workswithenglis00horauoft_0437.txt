ODE XXIV.

Ah in the roni-tamn Ode os Book Second, so hem also, the poet inveighs against tho
luxury and corruption os his countrymen, and draws in eontrast a picture os the man-
ners os ruder, but simplet and more virtuous nations. In allusion, doubtleae, to the plans

mian of a puter and better discipline.

tening adamantine spikes into the tops of lofty buildings is sufficiently
bold, but to represent Neeessity driving such spikes into a human head
is scarcely less than ludicrous, certainly quite unworthy of Horace. In
illustration of Necessitas and of clavos, see Ο. ἰ., 35, 18. —v- campes-

They are called profugi in O. i., 35, 95 and iv., 14, 42. Described by
Homer, and many succeeding writers, as a people of simple manners,
