316 nom on 'rim omns.

Od. iv„ 3863 Virgil, Georg. iv„ 395.——8. Visere· Poetis for ut vi»
νεα, οι· ad visendum. Such a use of the infinitive is common in Horu»
and other poets. —- 10. columbis. This is the reading ofall the MSS.
Some editors would correct the poet, and read palumbis ,- but cobumbaiu
the generic word. 13. Flavum. The usual epithet for the Tiber,
which applies to it now as well as in thc time of Horace. 'l'he color is
owing doubtless to the sand and mud which the stream bears along
with it. —- 14. Litore Etruse03 i. e. the shore of the Mare Tyrrhenum,
into which the river empties. The waters of the river, instead of being
discharged into the sea, are described as being tkrmtm back, so as to in-

undate the city—15. monumenta regis. The palace of Numa, to
which these words refer, was built at the root os the Palatius, overlook-

ing the upper or eastern extremity of the Forum3 and it was so joined
to the temple of Vesta, that it was often called Atrium Vestae ,- it ’πα
also called Atrium Regium, or simply Regia. Hence the close connec-
tion of the two buildings in this passage. 1¹¹1. Malu quemn·
Nimium is an adverb3 the too complaining ,- not nimium 'deor-em, assome
read, contrary to the collocation of the words, and to the sense of the
passage. As Ilia, the mother of Romulus and Remus, was throwu into
the Anio (which flows into the Tiber)‚ the poet, here, by a bold figure,
represents her as married to the god of the stream, who avenges her
wrong-s, by inundating the city. — 18. Shlstrt3 the Roman side3 the
left, of course, as you look down the river. —21. mm 10118803 sc. ad-
versus cives; the poet now touches upon the destructive civil wars, that
followed the death of Caesar. 22. Persae. The Parthiam (for it is
these, whom the poet means) were at this time the most formidable of
the enemies of Rome. “ Horace uses the terms Medi, Persae, Parthi,
indiscriminately3 since the Empire of the East had passed from the
Medos to the Persians under Cyrus, and from them to the Parthians
under Arsaces.”—0sborne. 25. Vocet. See Arn. Pr. Intr. 424. —
2⁶. Imperi rebus. For the form of the gen. see Z. §4st Rebus is
dative—2⁵1. mnus audientem. Vesta, too, is represented as angi&
with the Romans, because Julius Caesar was Pontifex Maximus. Hence
she says in Ovid, Fasti, iii., 699:

 

 

 

 

Ne dubita, meus ille fuit, meus ille sacerdon
Sacrilegae telis me petiere manus.

82. Augur Apono. Iuvoked first of all, as the god of divinationi,
from whom mortals may leam how the anger of the gods may be ap-
peased; also because he was one of the tutelary deities of Troy.—
88. Erycin3 from Mt. Eryx, in Sicily, where was a temple of Venus.
— u. locu—cupid03 always represented by the poets as the attend—
ants of Venus—86. Rapum. Resfficere, to look wita savom said of
