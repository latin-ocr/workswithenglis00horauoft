xxvi mn OF ΗοΒΑοΕ.

But the close resemblance of some passages to existing frag·
ments of Greek poetry is no sufficient ground for the opinion
often expressed, that the Roman lyrist was a mere copyist of
Greek originals; and it was a singularly gratuitous observar
tion of an early critic,¹ “that if the Lyrics of the Greeks were
extant, very many of the thefts might be detected.” On the
contrary, those picces and parts of pieces which, by the pre»
senoe of the originale, we know were borrowed from Greek
writers, so far from diminishing the reputation of the Roman
poet, are such as none bnt a master could produce3 his trans-
lations of single words and phrases are executed with such a
rare felicity, that the language “ seems to be born, as it were,
· with the thought,'’ and those passages, which arc reprodnc-
tiens from the Greek, are written with such a boldness and
genial freedom, that they admirably illustrate that power of
adaptation, which fixes the stamp of originality upon an ao-
knowledged imitation.² And we may use for Horace, as War-
ton has done for Pope,⁸ the words with which Virgil is said
to have replied to those who accused him of bon-owing from
Homer: “ Cur ‘nou illi quoque eadem furta tentarent?
Verum intellecturos, facilius esse Herculi clamm, quam
Homero versum .‹›·urripere.'’⁴

But very many of the best odes of Horace are so thorongh·
ly Roman in their whole character, in their occasion, subjecte,
sentimenta, imagery, and allusions, that they could by no pos-
sibility have been formed upon Greek models, but are pecu·
liarly and exclusively his own. This class includes those
which celebrate the glories of Augustus in peace and in war,
and the two which describe the victories of his step-sons
