can work recently published, Andrews’s Latin Lexicon3 the
other references need no particular explanation.

The Life of Horace, which has been written for the work,
together with the brief estimate connected with it of the char-
acter and writings of the poet, will perhaps be a source of
some interest and value to the student.

The illustratione, which have been introduced with a view
at once to the embellishment and the usefulness of the book,
have been, with three exceptione, taken from Rich’s Illus-
trated Oompanion; those on pages 204 and 241 have been
taken from Becker’s Gallus, and the one on page 309 from
Milman's elegant edition of Horace.

It is hoped that the superior mechanical execution of the
volume will gain the attention and praise which it merits3 and
Ι cannot but acknowledge the very liberal manner in which
the Publishers have superintended it, sparing 110 pains or ex-
pense to make it as perfect as possible.

1 avail myself of this opportunity to make my grateful
acknowledgments to Professors and Classical Teachers for the
very favorable reception which they have given to my edition
of Livy 3 and to express the hope that the present work, the
result of a larger experience and of more extended labors,
may be found not unworthy of their approbation.
