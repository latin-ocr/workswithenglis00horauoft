EPISTLE ΙΙ.

This highly finished Epistle, full os illustration of the poet’s lise md character, we·
addressed ιο Julius Florus. (See Introd. to Epist. i., 3.) Florus had complained, tint
Horace had not, in sulfilment os his promise, sent to him, while absentia the Eut, in the
suite os Tiberius, any os his poetieal compositions. The poet, in replying to his friend's
wmplaint, professes to excuse himself sor his silence.

He contends, in a familiar illustration from a slave-dealer, that he h'ad wsmed hb
friend that he might not keep his word (1-25); and in another illumuon from a sol-
dier in the army os Lucullus, that the reasons which once urged him to poetic-l eom-
position, now no longer existed (mi-57). He proceeds to mention various grounds fer
hisgrowing indisposition ιο write ; the capricious tastes os readers (58-64); the distraet-
ing cares, and the noise and tumult os a city lise (65-86); the mutual admiration and
flattery os small poets (81 ΗΕΒ in contrast with which he describes the losty aim· and
difficult task os the true poet (los-140). Finally, he alleges in his desence his confirmed
attachment to the study os philosophy, and thence elides, in his usual happy manner,

into some of his savorite precepts os wisdom, with which he closes the Epistle (ul-end).
This Epistle has been imitated by Pope.
