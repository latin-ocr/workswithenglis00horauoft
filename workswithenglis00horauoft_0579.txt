Euripiden comp. n. Epod. iii , 12, 13. — 110 —Orestes- Ino md
Orestes were subjecta of Euripides3 Ixion of Aeschylus3 Io is intro-
duced in the Prometheus of Aeschylus. Ino was the wife of Athamas
The story was, that one of her sons was killed by her husband, and
that she herself, being pursued by him⁷ threw herself into the sea. The
epithet perfidus refers to the story of Ixion's betraying Deioneus into s
pitml of lire, and of his abuse of Jupiter’s hospitality5 vaga to Io's
being changed into a heifer, and driven over the earth by a gad-fly,
through the vengeance of J uno. -—- iss—127 Here is more fully
given the precept in the latter half of l. 119, relating to new characters.

troverted passage. Ι shall give first, what seems to me the true inter-
pretation, in detail and on the whole, and then add a brief statement
md criticism of two interpretations, which are held by other Editors.
1. In the first place, of the most important expression, proprie com-
munia dicere. Of this the right view is given by Gesner, in explaining
proprie duxere, as follows: “Proprie dicere esc ita undique describere ac
finire, ut jam mm commune quiddam aut generale videatur, sed individu-
m, iu quo omnia sunt detemimta.⁷' 'rhat is, commune means the ab·
struet, the general, and so communia abstract ideas, general conceptions.
The opposite is proprium, the concrete, the particular, and propria, em-
bodiments of abstract ideas in individual forms of character—As illus-
trative of commune in the above sense. comp. Cic. de Invent. i., 18 affl,
&52; de off. ii., 1⁰3 Quintil, vii.‚ 1, 285 xii„ 10, 42; Tac. Ann. iii.‚27.
—To illustrate from Horace himself: the epithets just above in l. 121
eontain so many communia or abstract conceptions, to which Homer’s
genius gave individual form and embodiment in the Achilles of the
niad. So we might- inustrate of the Medea, the Ino, and the other cha·
meters of the Grecian drumm and so of other characters in ancient
und in modern literature. Accordingly proprie dicere means to describe
particularly, to individualize3 and the whole expression means: inform,
srom general ideas, individual characters. Now to proeeed with the
other expressions. Tuqueg the que expresses inference; and so, and ao-
cardingly. --- Iliacum car-eng i. e. Iliadem, tlte Iliad ,- of course men-
tioned by Horace only by way of example. —Dednds ln ιαιες to
drsw out into ncts3 i. e. make a. dmm of, dramatize. As to the con-
struction of deducis with proferres, observe that it is briefly put for,
“ rectius facis, si deducis—quam faceres, si proferres ” (Orelli). If now
we add, that proferres primus refers to the sume thing as proprie dicere,
we have the connection, aud the sense, on the whole, as follows: the
difficulty mentioned is suggested by the rule just before given sor form·
ing new characters3 the difficulty itself is that of invention, confessed-
ly the greatest tssk of the poet, und requiring the highest gisss of ge-
