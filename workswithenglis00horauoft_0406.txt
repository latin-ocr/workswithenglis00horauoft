ODE XVI.

Repose all men seek ἰοῖς but they seek it, where it can never be found, out of mm
selves. For not honore nor riches ean get it, but humble desires, and a quiet seul (1-16).
Why then seek elsewhere sor peace, when it ean dwell only within oux-solves ‘l For is in
our own souls are care and a guilty conscience, these must go with us, whatever we go
(17-24). Be glad, then, in the joys os life, and temper its ills with a quiet mila for m-
thing earthly is completely blest, nor may all enjoy the same, but each hu ι difflmm,
lot (25-end).

Thus does the poet describe the sat-al error os men in the pursuit of repone, ond show
where alone true repose is found.
