and tedicus introducti0n3 the first (as is generally supposed) that of
the Thebals of Antimachus, which professing to treat of the return of
Diomedes to Aetolia after the second siege of Thebes, began with re-
counting the wonderful death of Diomed⁷s‚ uncle Meleager. The story
was that Meleager wasted away and died, when Althaea threw into the
fire the hinet, on which, as announced by the Fates, soon after his
birth, his life depended. See class Dict. The second poem was on the
Trojan war, and started with the fable of Jupiter and Leda, and the
birth of Helen and of Castor and Pollux from the two eggs of the
swan—148. Ad eventnm3 i. e. the conclusion, or what is called the catas-
trophe of a piece. This rule of the poet (see above n. 136-152) may
be illustrated in all the great epics, both ancient and modern; e. g. the
Iliad and the Odyssey, the Aeneid‚ and the Paradise Lost3 so too in the
master-pieces both of the ancient and the modern drama. The rnle
applies also to all fictitious writings in prose, such 'as novels and ro-
mances. 151. Mentitur3 invents; veris falsn; trum with fiction.

following ne, rather than with what has gone before3 notwithstanding
