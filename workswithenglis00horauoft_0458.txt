plainly alludes to the commemoration of the deeds of the elder Scin!-
by his friend Ennius, who was born at Rudae, in Calabria. But inaen-
ἀίω Carthaginis can only refer to the younger Scipio, who destroyed
Carthage by fite 1³.c. 146. Hence some suppose these words in l. 17 to
refer to the burning of the camps and of the fleets of the carthaginim
in the Second Punic War, related by Livy, Β. 30, 5, 6, 43. Others resort
to conjectural readings, as impendia, stipendia ,· which Dillenburger well
calls a desperate remedy, as the MSS. all agree upfflnoendia. Bentley
rejected the line as spurious. On the whole, the conclusicn of Orelli
(in his Excursus) seems most probable, that several lines, he thinks
two, have in some way been lost after l. 17, which if present would re-
lieve the passage of all difficulty. This conclusion gathers strength
from the view of Meinecke, that Horace always wrote odes of this
measure in stanzas of four lines. By the addition of two lines, the odo
would have nine such stamas—23. Puer. Romulus, whose deeds
were sung by Ennius in his Annales. Dillenburger quotes a passage of
Ennius, which occurs in Cic. de Republ. l, 41. Ennius lived about mc.
230, and was the contemporary and friend of Scipio and Laelius.—
