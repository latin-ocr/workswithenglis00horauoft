An Epistle addressed ῑο a brother poet, Albius Tibullus, nt the time st his ville nt
Pedum. Horace compliments him on his poetic gists and attainments, on his good
hesim, and his fortunate social position, and exhons him not ιο be disturbed by cares-td
sense, but to live a quiet and cheersul lise.

Horace pleasantly describes himself as such an Epicurean as the Stoice
were fond of descfibing, and such a one, too, as many persons doubtless
ποι-ος one who made the chief good to consist merely in sensual
pleasure3 but his own Epicureanism was a quiet, cheerful enjoyment of
life, together with an ascendency over base and corroding desim.
Tibullus, and every one else who knew Horace and his manner of lile,
at once appreciated the jesting tone of these two concluding lines of the
Epistle.

 

EPISTLE V.

An Epistle to Torquatus, the same friend os the poet, to whom is inscribed tho
Seventh Ode os Book Fir-st. Horace invites his friend ω jein him, on the eve of the
birth-day of Augustus, at his srugal table, and bids him put asside the anxious cuns of
life, and give himself up uo cheersul discentes, and all the gay aud inspiring mnusnees of
the festive hour.

This is one os those lighter pieces os Horace, which seem to bring us into the
presence os the poet in his own home, and show us how he loved there to guther about
him his friends, and with such cheer ss his house might afford, share with them the
‹lolights os socia-l converse.
