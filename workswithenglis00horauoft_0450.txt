ODE III

As in the :ioth Ode os Book Sem›11d‚the poet here also addresses Melpomene,oe his
patroness, his choi-iahed Mune. ¹rhe man, he says, on whom at his birth she look- with
friendly eye, wins renown; not indeed in Grecian games (2-5), nor in Roman arms (629),
but in lyric song (lo-12). Himsels has Rome, the queen of enies, deig-ned to rank among
her poets; the Roman public awards him the title os master qt* the Ronm tyre. An
this belongs ιυ Melpomene—the inspiration‚ the honor, all is hers (13-24).

Dillenburger mentions with approval the opinion os weber, that Horace wrote this
ode ω express his joy at the praises which he gained from the emperor and'the pooplo,
by his Secular Hymn.
