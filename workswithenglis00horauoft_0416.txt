ODE III.

This is a genuine Roman ode. It sings the praises of inflexible firmness of purpos-
(commuue), a cardinal Roman virtue; and utters the true national feeling touehing tl„
greatness of the Roman name and the perpetuity os the Roman state. On the mention
os Romulus as an eminent example os this virtue, the poet is transporoed in imaginationi
to the assembled council os the gods, and hears the words os Jnno on the admission of
Romulus to divine honore. True to her ancient hatred, the goddess queen maists that
Troy shall be lest to eternal desolation ; on this condition she consents ω the deificatum
of Romulus, and to the destiny os Rome as the ruler os the world.

From this allusion to Troy, we may inser that the poet had in mind the mmored in·
tent-ion os Julius Caesar, recorded by Suetonius (Caes. 79), οἰ transferring the neat of
government to ancient Ilium.

1. ‘renem propositi. Steadfast ‚· like the prose expression proposi-
bam tenere, as in Livy, 3, 51; but tenax is frequently used -in the sense
of obstinate. ΤΒΘ connection of the epithet with justum makes its
meaning evident. 2. Iubentium. anere is the regular expression
with populus, as jubere legem, jubere regem. Observe the use os the word
with the acc. prava, and see A. δι S. ὓ 223, R. 2 (2), and Z. §412—
8. Tyranni. Orelli mentions that the first eight lines of this ode were
uttered by the celebrated Cornelius de Witte, when put to the ταοὶ.
Compare the lines of Juvenal, 8, 80, seqq.:

 

“Phalaris licet imperet, ut sis
Falsus, et admoto dictet perjuria tauro,
Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,
Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.”

—90 Arte. That is, by constantia. In ars here, there is something of
the force os the Greek ἀρετη, virtue, quality of chamaan—11. Ro-
enmbens. ΤῙιο poet represents Augustus as already enjoying divine
honors. So also in Ο. iii., 5, 2; iv, 5, 32; Epist. ii., 1, 15. In the same
manner virgil speaks of Augustus in Ecl. 1, 63 deus ‘nobis Ilaec otia fecit.
Namque erit ille ‘milti semper deus. Coming from men like Horace and
Virgil, such language is not to be summat-ily disposed osas nothing but
servile adulation; in perfect accordance with the ideas of the audente,
who exalted to the rank of gods men who were illustrious on earth, it
is to be regarded as the language of poetic exaggeration, denoting the
high respect and admiration of these poets fo'r one, who, in the language
of Buttman, “was in his time, the most important personage in the
world.’' —— 12. Purpureo. Poe-tic, like roseo ore applied by Virgil, Aen.
2, 593, to Venus, and by Ovid, Met. 7, 705, to Aurora. This it were not
necessary to observe, did not some, with a painsul preeision, explain the
epithet by connecting it with the color of nectar. —— 14. Indoelll. Un-

. iamed—R. Quirinus. As Livy relates the story, 1, 16, Romulus
