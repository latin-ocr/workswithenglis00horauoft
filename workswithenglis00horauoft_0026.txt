ΣΧ mm· OF HORAOE.

declined the advances made by Augustus himself; when, so-
licitedby him to accept the place of his confidential secretary‚¹
he respectfully refused it, and when afterwards assured by
him, in his letters, of his undiminished regard, and urged to
come without ceremony to his palace and his table,⁸ the poet
showed himself nowise disposed to avail himself of the tempt-
ing offers of the emperor.³

We have thus touched upon the leading events in the life of
Horace. The struggles of his youth, overcome by the exer-
cise of his poetic talents, were followed in manhood by ample
and abiding consolations,—fame, independence, friends, the in-
timacy of Maecenas, and the favor of Augustus. He com·
manded a position agreeable to his tastes and wishes, and
sminently favorable to the development of his poetic charac-
ter. Enjoying free access to the court of Augustus, and to
the brilliant circles of the capital, and thus brought into oon·
neotion with· all men of distinction in letters, in the state, and
in the world, he was familiar with the manners a‘nd forms of
character of Roman society, and with all the best intellectual
and social influenees of Roman life. And when wear-y of the
tumults and busy soenes of the city, he could avail himself of
all the advantages and pleasures of country life; he could
visit his favorite Tibur,⁴ where, by “the headlong Anio and
the grove of Tiburnus,'’ he passed in rambling and study

disputed point, whether Horace owned a place at Tibur, or when there,
lived in a villa of Maecenas. A passage in Suetonius favors the former
view: Vixit plurimum in secessu ruris sui Sabinimast Tiburtini, donumque
ejits ostenditwr circa Tffiurni mulum.
