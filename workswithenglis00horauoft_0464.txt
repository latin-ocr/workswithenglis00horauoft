called Janus Qun-imis (and here Quirini), from its ,being connected by
an ancient tradition with Romulus. It was built at the north-western
angle of the Forum, and had two gates, hence called Geminus or Bi-
stons, one looking towards the east, the other towards the west. It was
open in timtae of war, and closed in time of peace. Before the time os
Augustus, it had been closed twice; once in Numa’s reign, and moe
n. c. 235, after the First Punic War. In the time of Augustus it was
closed thrioe3 after the battle of Actium, s. c. 25, aster the overthrow
of theCantabri, B. c. 25, and now for the third time after the subjuga-
tion of the Rboeti and the Vindelici—See Becker’s Handb. d. Rom.

In distinction from the Phrygian (see note, Ο. iii., 19, 18), the Lydian
pipe was adapted to a quick and lively style of music. The plural is
used, tibiis, because the ancients played upon two pipes at the same
time. They were called tibiae pares (equae), when they were both base,
or both treble; and tibiae impares, when one was base and the other
treble. Each pipe was a separate instrument, having its own instru-
ment, though both were played by the same musician. There was also
a distinction of tibia dextra, and tibia sinistra ; the former was held in
the right hand, and produced the base notes, hence called by Herodotus
the “male'’ or ‘⁴ manly '' pipe; the latter was held in the lest hand, and
produced the treble notes, hence called the “female'’ or “womanly”
pipe—See Dict. Antiqq„ and Rieh’s Companion. under Tibia3 and tho
illustration on p. 139 of this volume.
