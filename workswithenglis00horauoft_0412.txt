contend, appealing in illustration of vocare to Ο. ἰί., 18, 10, me petit ,- and
they reject the construction quem vocas Dilecoe, Maecenas, though gram-
matical (as Sat. ii„ 6. 20; Epist. i„ 7, 373 i.2 16, 59), beca the versi-
fication is against it, aud because Maecenas cannot witho violenoe be

know and admire my poetry. Already in the time os Horace, books
were in demand in Spain and Gaul. See Horace, Epist. i.. 20, 13.—
21. Noniae. The dirges sung by the praefica, women hired for the
purpose at funerals. Horace alludes to the same thing in A. P. 431.—
