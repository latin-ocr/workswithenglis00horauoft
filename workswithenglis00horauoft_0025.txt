Jeet of undeserved animadversion3 his acquiescenoe in the
emperor's sole dominium his praises, in verse, of the majesty of
his person, of the triumphs of his armS, and the peaceful glories
of his reign, have provoked from hasty critics the charge of
servile adulation, and of a weak abandonment of cherished
sentimenta It was certainly a mark of good sense in the
poet, and was a good fortune for the world, that at the fatal
battle of Philippi he did not, like Brutus, throw himself upon
his sword, or like a few of his comradeS, impracticably adhere

spirit and noble death of Cato.⁵ And in his personal rela-
