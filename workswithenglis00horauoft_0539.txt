EPISTLE Ἰ.

‘l'his Epi-tle was occasioned by the desire os Maecenas, that Horace should give him-
sols with renewed ardor to the cultivation os lyric poeti-y. The poet declares. in rep1y,
that, with aduncing years, he has lost his tasio sor the sportive effusione os the Lyric
nune, and is now ahsorbed in the studies of philosophy (1-12). He then proceeds,—dis-
claiming. at the same time, all allegiance ιο sect, and waiving all pratensions to the high·
est attainments in philosophy (13-40), ιο set forth and inculcata some os his savorite doc-
trines os practica] wisdom. He teat-,hes that virtue is sar better than money, that a good
conscience aud a comeum, independent mind are superior ιο all worldly goods (41—69);
and he conti-asts these teachings with the opinions and conduct os the multitude, which
ho shows to be various, uncertain, and inconsistent (70-end).

2· nonatum—rude. Horace compares himself with a gladiator who
had gained an honorable discharge. In token of such discharge, a
gladiator was always presented with a rudis, a staff. or soil. 3. Ludo.

gladiator was sometimes won back to the amphitheatro by prospecte of
high pay; he then ran the same risks as an ordinary gladiator, and, if
worsted in fight, was at the mercy of the populace. When appealed to,
the populace turned up their thumbs (vertere pollwem) as a sign, that
the gladiator should be spared, and turned them down (premere) as a
sign that he should be put to death. —9. ma dueat3 literally, draw

image of a gladiator. Addimus, used primarily of an insolvent debtor

 

- given over to his creditor, was also used of a person who became a

gladiator for hire, because he was bound to the master of the school in
which he was trained. Such a person also took an oath of allegiance
to his master on entering his service. See Dict. Antiqq. under Nea-i,
and Gladiatores. — la. Nunc, etc. Preserving the image drawn stom
the sea which is first used in the preceding line, the poet proceeds to
describe himself pleasantly as a kind of Eclectic in philosophy, now
studying the Stoics and now the Epicureans. —Aguls The Stoics
taught their disciples to mingle actively in public affairs. —18.
