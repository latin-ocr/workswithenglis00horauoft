of quality, and even os royal birth.

Prius. Before yma—3. Brisels. In the first book of the Iliad, Ho-
mer relates the love of Achilles for Briseis, and his mingled grief and
anger, when she was carried away by the order of Agamemnon. She
had been taken captive at the fall of Lyrnessus, and became the prize
of Achilles, ——8. Tecmessae. The daughter of Teuthras, the king of
Phrygia, taken captive by Ajax; referred to in Sophocles's Ajax, 210.

the division of the spoils at Troy, fell to the share of Agamemnon, who
carried her with him to Mycenae. She had been ravished by Asu, the

vum——lustrnm3 i. e. in his fortieth year3 a poetic, beautiful turn of ex-
pression for this idea3 is hastem'ng to close its eightlt bustmm. Every
five years, at the completion of the census, it was customary to offer a
sacrifice, lustrum (from luo), for the whole people; the expression for
this was condere lustrum. Hence the' period itself was called a bustmm.
Horace prefers here to use claudere, but yet we find condere in poetry;
thus Orelli cites condere diem, Horace, Ο. iv., ὃ, 29; condere soles, Virg.
Ecl. 9, 52; and condere secla, Lucretius, 3, 1104.
