and not with an already reduced metal.'’ There is some unoertainty,
however, in the name mountain-bronze, owing to its being uncertain
what the ore was, with which it was mixed. If it was zinc ore (as the
ancients seem not to have known zinc as a metal) then the composition
was akin to brass. But if it was tin, as is the case with most of the
ancient specimens of χαλκός or αεε. then the composition was. of course,
bronze. See Dict. Antiqq„ under the word—Vincta mund,- as
probably the later flute wa long. and therefore composed of parts, like
our flate, and bound at the joints with brass or bronze—2⁰³.

one that immediately precedes. and assign, as the reason of the de-
parture from the simplieity of the early music. and of the adoption of
a freer style, the promiscuous character of. the audienoe. Such a

 

 

mixed crowd wanted louder and more varied music—Stin there is
much difficulty in the passage. as in the earliest times the andience2
though not large. yet must have been promiscuous, and certainly not
more cultivated than the audience of later times. Besides, we can
hardly suppose that the poet means to censure the later music, as
really inferior to the earlier—It is an ingenious conjecture of Engel,
that these two lines do not belong here. but rather below, immediately
