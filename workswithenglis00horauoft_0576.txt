words adopted into Latin with a slight change, e. g. of termination,
but of Latin words formed prudently according to the analogy of
Greek ones. Orelli adduces, in illustrati0n‚ centimanus, taunsormis,

etc. In illustrating the change and decay to which all human things
are subject, the poet here compliments Augustus by referring to the
construction of the Portus Julius, or Julian Harbor. This great public

crine with Lake Avernus, and then opening a communication between
the basin thus formed, and the sea. Comp. n. Ο. ἰί., 15, 4. —Aquil-

“per nedum res tollitur omnino, atque dieitur non in considerationem
venire. Id vero in negativa sententia eam rationem habet, ut res, quae
dicitur, multo minus quam ante dicta suum locum obtineat3 in affirma-
