SATIRE X.

ln this satire Horace defends and establishes the crmcxsm passed by him upon Lu-
essim in the Founh os this Book3 a criticism which appears ιο have given offena ιο the
admira-s os that poet. ⁸

110 renews against Lucilius the charge os clumsy versificatiom and, while he con-
aedes again his wit, proceeds ιο show that not wit alone, but wit in unison with other
qualium, forms the merit os true satire (1-19). He then censures another fault os Lu-
cilius, the large introduction of Greek words, the allusion ιο which leads ιο a mention of
h'n own earlier efforts at writing Greek verse, and his subsequen: resolution ιο write only
in Latin, and ω write satire (2349). He removes the objection‚ that he had disparaged
Lucilius and exalted himself, by declasing that even Homer may be criticised, and that
Lucilius criticised other poem: and, aster declaring that ‘Lucilius would have written
with more care, is he had lived at a latet age. he goes on io insist that nothing but sre-
quent connecting and the mmosz pains in composing ean entiue one's poetry m a second
reading, orto the favorable judgmem os the “fit audie-nce. though [σνς’ os true critice
(50—74). finally, he deprecates sor himself the applause os the vulgar, and expresses
the hope that his poetry may win favor with his brother poets and with literary men
