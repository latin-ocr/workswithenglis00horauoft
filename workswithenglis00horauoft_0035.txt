cultivated, vell-regulated mind, in reasonable desires, in an
even, oontented spirit. It is here that we discover the secret
of Horace’s power over so many minds3 it is not his style,
with its rare union of elegance and vigor, it is not his terse-
ness and felicity of expression,—these alone could never ex-
phin nor could they create so wide and enduring s popular-
ity; but it is the wise thoughts, just sentimenta, and genuine
tnths, universally applicable to the every-day lives of men,
which are the staple of his work, and of which the graces of
style, the felicitous expression, are the rich and finished set-
ting,—it is these that have made him the favorite companion,
not only of classical scholars, but of statesmen, philosophers,
and men of the world ; the most read, the best remembered‚
and the most frequently quoted of all the writers of antiquity.
The fame of Horace has far exceeded the measure of his
own proud prophecy.¹ It has outlived those solemn proces-
sions to the Capitol of pontiffs and vestal virgins, it has out-
lived the entire religion of ancient Rome, and ancient Rome
itaelf, and after the lapse of ages, it still flourishes in all its
early freshness ; and with equal truth and beauty has it been
described in an apostrophe to Horace, by an Italian poet:

Salgo la eima ombrosa, e freseo e verde
Veggio l'alloro tuo lassu tenersi,

Che per sl lunga eta foglia non perde:

Veggiol dell’ immortal tua lira adorno,
E le immagini belle e i sacri versi
Con la grand' Ombra tua girarvi intorno.

“ 1 climb the shady summit, and behold
Thy laurel there still ever fresh and green,
Which thro’ long ages not a leaf hath lost:

1 see it decked with thy immor-tal lym,
And beauteous images and sacred verse
Still wandering round it with thy mighty chade.
