“Is happiness hae not her sent
And centre in the bream,
We maybewise orrich orgreu,
But never ean be blest:
Nae treasures nor plen-sures
could make us happy lang,
The hean’s aye the pan aye,
'nnat makes ns right or wrang.”

l· Odi, etc. “This first stanza,’' as Dillenburger remarks, “is in-
hoductoryss’ not merely to this ode, but “to the first six odes of this
Book ;'' as these au have a like moral complexion, and sim in common
to recall the ‹it-generate Romans to the simple manners of ancient
times, and to the cultivation of those virtues, which are necessary to
private and public happiness. Hence the poet, secking to exercise the
high functions of a moral teacher, styles himself a priest ⁰s tlte Muses,
merdas Musarum ,· and in these first two lines, borrows the expressions,
wont to be uttered by the priests, when about to reveal the sacred mys-
teries —Profnm- vulgus. Comp. Virgil, Aen. 6, 258, Procul, o pro-
cul, este profani ,- and th‘e Greek ἑκάς, ends ἔστε βέβηλοι. These words
of Horace are osten quoted as the expression of sn aristocratic feeling;
bnt ss used by himself they betray no such feeling, and have no such
meaning. Τὶιε profani, in the original sense of the word, are the unini-
tiated, to whom the sacred mysteries have not been revealed3 and in
the sense os Horace here, they are those who have not true wisdom‚
and care not forits teechings.-——2. Favete linguis3 the formula of
the priests, by which a sacred silence was enforced5 the Greek εὐφη-
μεῖτε. Tm words of Virgil are similar, in Aen. 5, 71, Ore saneta· and
of Ovid, Fast. 1, 71, unguis, animisque favete. ——4- virginibus pueris-
que. The poet. designed his lessons of wisdom chiefly sor the Roman
youth. These words have no rereiegife to a chorus. ὅ. Guges· In
