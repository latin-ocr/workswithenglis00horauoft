cessarily limits the allusion to the second Tarquin‚ as we cannot sup-
pose, that, if Horace had intended Tarquinius Priscus⁷ he would have
selected the very epithet by which the younger Tarquin was always
desigmted in Roman history. The expression is equivalent to impetun
mque-ii Superbi. Notwithstanding the odious character of this prince,
his reign, brilliant alike in victories abrosd, and in the great public
wei-hs with which he adorned the city, forms an epoch in the early Ro-
mn annals; md Horace might therefore well mention his name in emi-
nection with Romulus, who founded the state, and Numa, who gave it
hws and peaoeful institutions. Dillenb. aptly quotes Cic. Phil. 3, 4:
Quasi vero ille rem Romanam, a Romulo prinum conditam, a Numa
Pompilio leg-ibus institutisque temperatam non omniun maxime auxerit et
amplificaverit, qni, ut Cato liber-tate, ita ipse regno dignu-mm fuit. See,
on this passage snd the whole ode, Buttmann, Mythologus, vol. 1. —
85. fito-h abne letum. Having mentioned the illustrioris names of
the kingly period, the poet turns with admiration to that of Cato. It
is the Cato, commonly called Uticensis, who, despairing of the repub-
lic, and determinet! not ιο survive its sall, put an end to his lise at Utica,
when that place was compelkd ιο surrender to Caesar. Mistaken and

and his manly support of what he believed to be just and right. In the
