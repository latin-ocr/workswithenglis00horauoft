'min is the clam os persons whom Horace here saurim. The following description
os the method which the poet adopted, 1 quote from Keighuey. The Satin-e, abounding
in irony, may, as Grotesend says, be regarded as a kind os travesty, from its transferring
the manners os the times of Augustus to the heroic age. ln the Eleventh Book os the
Odyssey (v., 99 seq.)‚ the seer Tiresias gives ulysses a prophetie narrative os what was
to berall him, in which he tells him that on reaching home, he would find all in confusion
there, und his whole substance eaten up by the suitur-s os his wife, whom, however, he
would put to death. 0111- poet then makes ulysses put the natural question ω Tiresias,
how, now that he had lost every thing he was bringing from Troy and elsewhere, and, as
he mys, ho should find all gone at home. he was ιο get the means os living'l and Tiresia
theu tells him to tum legata-humer, and instructs him in the necessary asts.

Apotheca- See n. O. iii„ 8, 11. 9. Missis ambagibus. Join with
pauperiem—horres, in which two words Tiresias sums up all that Ulys-

wall. —- 18. Utue, etc. A form of question, expressive of indignation.

lines-Dama. is a common name for a slave 3 here, for one who had been
a slave—25. Praei-oso hamo. Metaphor from a fish, who bitesoff
the hook, and thus escapes with the bait3 here meant for the gifts
which the sly old man quietly takes, without getting caught. 32.

verbial expression for a thing of small value, as we say, osa fig, osa
straw, &e 88. Cogntur, his auorum—40. Infantes, mute. In
this whole passage the poet doubtless meant to ridicule the inflated
language of Furius Bibaculus, already mentioned, in n. Sat. i., 10, 36.

rich old men with fish. 46. Sublatus. Taken up. The expression
has reference to the custom of exposing children, immediately after
