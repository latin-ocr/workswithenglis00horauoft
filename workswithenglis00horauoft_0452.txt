Some translate ubere as an adjective, agreeing with late,- but we can·
not believe that Horace would have used the same word as an adjective,
with which his readers were familiar as a substantive in the expression
depellere ab ubere. 1⁷. Raetis-Alpibus. This part of the Alpine
range, still called the Rhaetian Alps, is between the St. Gothard, in
Northern Italy, and the sources of the Adige‚.in the Tyrol. Its name
is from the Rhaeti, who lived on its southern sides, and whose territory
lay between Lake Como and the river Adige, the northern part of Lom-
bardy, and the southern of the Tyrol. — 18. vindelici. This German
tribe were the northern neighbors of the Rhaeti3 and their territory
extended from Lake Constance through the south os Bavaria, and the
north of the Tyrol. — Quibus—obstinet. Quibus depends upon obar-
met ,· but we translate such a dative by our possessive3 e. g. to whom
custom—arms (their) right hands, i. e. whose right hands—cmm arms,
etc. Unde deductus depends upon quaerere. obarmt is an unusual
word, which we should not expect to find in Horace. Indeed the pas-
sage quibus—sed is so heavy and prosaic, that its genuineness is qnes-
tioned, even by some of the best critics, who, omitting the whole, pro-

though he asserts the influence of a noble ancestry‚ yet insiste upon the
necessity os a right education, as essential alike to intellectual and to
moral excellence. ³5. Utcunque 3 quandocunque, whatever. — 88.
Hetaurnn ssmen. The battle of the Metaurus, a river in Umbria,
fought in B. c, 207, in which Caius Claudius Nero totally defeated Has-
druba13 a victory which inspired the Romans with fresh comage, and
gave a decisive and favorable turn to their affairs. ——n- Aluna—adorea·
Adoreu, sc. donatio, means properly a donative of ador, spelt, grain; given
to soldiers after a victory; hence, flgumtively, as here, for victory, mili-
tary glory. Smiled uim benignam victory. 42. nt. Ex quo, from
the time when. ——48. Deos—rectos. “ zze-established. The statues
were replaced, which had been thrown down by the invaders.'' Os-
