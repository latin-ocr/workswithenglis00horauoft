NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SEGULAR HYMN.

1. ΤΗΒ festival os the Secular Games, together with the' name iuslf, Ludi Soman-
ree, was peculiar to the period os the Empire. The real object os its introductioni and
first celebration was to do honor to Augustus and to his government, the first ten years os
which had just passed away. lt seemed a fitting occasion, by means ot· a series os public
games, at once to acknowledge and ω secure the supreme power os Augustus, and to
hand down his name to posterity, as the restorer os the state smm etr-ise and amrehy to
harmony and established order. The Quindecemviri, in order to give greater cem to the
proposed gemes, eought to identify them with the existing Ludi rav-meai, which had
been celebrated but three times during the period os the Republic. They declarati unt
these games had been celebrated once in every century or eaectdum ,· and having cm-
sulted the Sybilline books, os which they hed charge, they formally announoed that tho
time had now arrived for another celebration.

2. But the Secular Games differed essentially from the Tarentino. '1'110 latter wore h
every instance celebrated sor the specific purpose os averting srom the state some pnm'ng

Capito was appointed to make the requisito arrangemente, and Horace was dimeted to
prepare an Ode. First os all, heralds were sent round to invite the people to a spectacla
which they had never seen before, and would never see again. Next, in anticipation os
the ceremonies, the Quindecemviri distributed among the free-born citizens, on the Pala-
tine and the Capitoline, torches, sulphur, and bitumen 3 and in these places, ss well as in
the temple os Diana on the Aventine, were alse distributed wheat, barlay, and Μ ι.
offerings to the Parcae.

The festival was solemnized in summer, and lasted three days and three nights.
Games were held in a place in the Campus Martius called Tarentum, and amincus wem
offered to the following deities: Jupiter and Juno, Apollo, Latona, and Diana, the Par-
cae, ω Carmenta, Ceres, and to Dis and Proserpina.

At the second hour of the night, the ceremonies were opened by the emperor, who, by
the river-side, sacriticed three lambs to the Parcae, upon three altars erecwd sor the pur-
pose. In the Tarentum a stage was ereeted, and on it was sung by a choira ‘festive

hymn. On this first day the people went to the Capitol to offer sacrifices, and then re·
turned to the Tarentum, to do honor to Apollo and Diana by singing choruses.
