1118 81111 of the year 43 B. c. It is probable that he went over
into Asia at the beginning of the year 42, and was with
Brutus and Cassius at their meeting in Sardis; and at that
time visited Clazomenae¹ and Lebedus,² and perhaps 011181
places? with which, in some of his poems, he seems to exhibit
a personal acquaintance. But he was certainly present 81
Philippi, in the summer of 42, and took part 111 that decisivo
battle, which sealed the fate of the republic. He 1188 re· ,

Philippi, confessing the abandonment of his shield 81111 his
