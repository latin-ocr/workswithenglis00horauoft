sence; the little Venusian estate yielded him no longer its
humble revenues, whether it had been sold, and the proceeds
were now exhausted, or had been lately confiscated along with
other Venusian lands, and assigned to some veteran of the
triumviral army; the son of a freedman, he had no rich family
connectione, and, an ex-tribune in the republican army, he
could hope for no favor from Octavianus and his associates.
Onsting about him for some way of support, he seems to have
found sufficient means, from the temnant of his patrimony, or
from some other source, to purchase the place of a quaestor's
clerk,¹ the small emoluments of which supplied his immediate
wants. But the condition of Horace at this time was far from
hopeless, and many a son of genius has risen to eminence
from circumstances much less propitious. He had ample
means of help near at hand, and within himself, and these
were to be fully developed by the pressure of necessity.
Nature had been kind to him at his birth ; and, besides endow-
ing him with rare intellectual gifts, had blessed him with a
parent, who had furnished him with all the means of educa-
tion, both at home and abroad, which the times afforded. His
studies at Athens had widened and enriched his earlier literary
culture; and even his brief and hapless military experience,
while it damped his youthful ardor, and taught him some
salutary lessons of life, added directly to his poetic resources,
by storing his mind with lively images caught from the camp
and the field. 'she exigencies of his situatiOn now forced him
to enter his proper career of literature3 “bold poverty,'’ to
use his own emphatic words, “ impelled him to write verses.'’²
These words have given rise to much speculation touching the
immediate motives and expectations of Horace3 but it seems
obvious from the words themselves and from the scope of the

scriptam. quaestoez'um comparavit. The only direct allusion which Horace
makes to his holding such an office, is in Sat. 2, 6, 36 ἃ, 37.
