tion as a man; he declined the tendered office¹ which would
attach him to his palace and his person, for he knew that such
an office, though it might bring him worldly distinction, would
involve him in a connection with thc emperor and his court, that
would be sure to bind, though in golden fetters‚ his personal
freedom. The same independent bearing he always observed in
his relations with Maecenas, and in an epistle' addressed to
him, which ranks among the most characteristic of his writ-

works, that, in his manhood and in all his later years, he gave
himself to an earnest study of moral and religious truth, and
sought to make a practical use of the results he reached3 his
profound veneration for the memory of his father, and his
warm acknowledgment of his virtuous precepts and example,⁸
are no slight proof of goodness of heart and life3 and his ex-
alted conceptions of a supreme Being, the all-powerful Creator
and the all-wisc and all-just Governor of the universe,⁴ his
distinct and grateful recognitions of an overruling Providenoe‚⁶
