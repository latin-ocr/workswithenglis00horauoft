BOOK ΙΙ.

SATIRE I.

In publishing this Second Book, Horace bestows a presawry satire apennina-me-
and detractore, who, it appears, had not been silenced by the earlier ndre- dinotet!
against them.

The poet pretends to come sor advice to C. Trebatius Testa, an eminent counsellor at
law. Bent as he is upon writing satiras, and yet pressed hard by these detractore, what
is to be done in the premises (1-5) ’Ξ Trebatius first advisoe him to keep quiet, which tho
poet declares to be quite impossible; then, if he must write, to praise αιοαη here the
poet pleads, first, that he lacks the ability, and second, that he waits sor that usk, a fitting
occasion (5-m). Warned by Trebatius, that satire will get him enemies, the poet still
persists that. he must follow in the track 'os Lucilius, and, though a lover os peace, that
he will employ against all such enemies the weapons nature has given him, and for the
uses intended by nature (21-60). Still warned by his counseI, that he may incur the ill-
will os the great, the poet cites the example os Lucilius, who did not lose by his satire
the favor os Laelius and Scipio (60-79). At last Trebatius is content to advise thathis
poet—client write nothing that is libellum: this advice Horace accepts with a pleasant
jem, and with a confident mention os his favor with Augustus, which shows how little he
cared sor the whole tribe os his detractor-s (lo—end).

With this ingenious desence. Horace gives this Second Book os Satires to the Roman
public. The whole tone os the Satire is that os one who is conscious osmer-it and of
succosa, os one who has already gained an established reputation as a poet. supported
by the advice ol· a Trebatius, confident os the courtly favor os Caesar, he is only emn-
tained and amused by the charges os envious poets and malicious critias.

This satire has been imitated by Pope, in his Satire addressed ω Mr. Fortescue.
