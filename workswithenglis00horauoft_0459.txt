diod mc. 566. His poetry approached the gravity and dignity ot· the
opio muse. Quintilian describes him as epici caminis mma lyra susti-
mntem. Hence the epithet here graves, ‘majesta—9· mareon.
Comp. n. Ο. i., 17, 18. —— 11. calores. Poetic sor amores, the passions,
or the impassioned lyrics3 the servm-s. In translation, preserve the
Latin order: yet breatloes tloe love, etc.— 12. Puellae. Genitive. The
allusion is to Sappho, of Mitylene, on the island of Lesbos0— 13. Non
sols—arsit. Ardis governs crines,- as the word has a kind ot· active
signification, ardently love, bum with love for ,- as in Virg. Ecl. 2, 1, Co-
rydon ardebat Alexin. ΤΙιθ verb also occurs with the abl„ Ο. ἰί., 4, 8;
iii„ 9, 55 and Epod. 14, 9. Here too the translation becomes more for-
cible, by imitating the Latin order: not Heben of Lacedaemon alam, etc.

15, 17. Cydon was a Cretan city. 18. Illcs; a Troy3 i. e. a great

Lollius had administered the government of Galatia with vigor, and
with great credit to himself ; and had been consul 13. c. 21. Up to the
time when this ode was written, and indeed for many years after, he
sustained an unblemished reputation, and stood high in the favor and
confidence of Augustus. But at a later period, atter the death of Ho-
race, he made himself odious by his avarice and other bad qualities of
character. ——390 consul. In apposition with animus. By a bold me-
taphor the poet describes the lasting influence of an upright character.
The consu] was the highest Roman magistrate, and held his office for a
single year. The upvigltt mind perpetuates its influence through all
succeeding years, and thus wears, as it were, the honors of a perpetual
consulship. —u- Honestum—utili. Honor to expediam. Horace uses
so strong and emphatic language, in describing the character of Lollius,
that there seems some ground forDillenburger’s conjecture, that he had

 

 

heard somewhat against him, and convinced of his innoeence, uncon-
sciously adopted the tone of a defender. ——440 Explicuit—arm. The
image seems to be that of a soldier, doing valiant and victorious battle
against fearful odds. So the good man by the arms of virtue triumphs
over the hosts of evil and of evil mem—With the sentiment of this pas-
sage, comp. O. iii„ 2, 19; and on the use of the perfects in the stanza,
see n. Ο. i., 28, 20.— 5⁰. PeJnsg used instead of magis, and it is more
forcible. So Epist. i., 17, 303 Cic. ad Fam. 7, 2. Dillenb. Flagitium
is any thing that brings with it infamy, disgrace. Such a man fears dis—
graoe, but shrinks not stom death itsels, for his friends or his country.
