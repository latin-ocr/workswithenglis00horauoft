that a large part of the N otes is solely the result of my pro-
fessional labors and experience.

The method which Ι have aimed to pus-sue in the prepara-
tion of the N otes is the same as that which Ι followed in my
edition of Livy, modified only by the character of the present
author, and by the fact that the reading of his works belongs
to a later stage of the course of study in our schools and col-
leges* While I have endeavored to keep in view the study of
the language in all its bearings, it has been a cherished object
to take advantage of the means so variously and richly fur-
nished by Horace for promoting the literary culture of the
student. I have sought to explain only real‘difficulties, and
these chiefly by suggestion and reference, and to give such
and so much aid, as may at once stimulate and reward the
pupil’s industrious efforts3 and also not to supersede or inter-
fere with the course of direct instruction and illustration
which every good teacher is aeeus‘tomed to follow with his
classes. The commentary on 'the Epistle to the Pisos‚ or the
Art of Poetry, is fuller and more extended than in any other
part of the work; a circumstance naturally occasioned by the
peculiar character and merits of that celebrated piece.

Of the editions Ι have consulted besides those already
mentioned, the following are the only ones which it is neees-
sary ιο name z the two of Duntzer, the one in four vols„
12mo., 1840-44, and the other in one volume, 8vo., 18493
