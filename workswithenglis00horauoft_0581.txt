primarily ιο the whole series of the ancient rables of the early poeta
(see below, n. on scriptor cyclicus); but it seems ιο be used here in the
aecondary sense os a commonplace round of topica. By the dwelling
upon such a common and obvious round, the poet means a mere mechani-

would not venture ιο step (pudor velet), or could not step, without vio-

but modest, as in Homer, so cluat tlte persor-manee shall far surpass what was

13⁸. scriptor cyclicus. In explanation of this expression, I quote the
following passages (putting in italica what speeially bears upon it),
from Grote’s Hist. of Greece, Vol. II¹7 pp. 165-1673 “the Alexandrino
literati, about the second century before the Christian era, arranged
the multitude of old epic poets into a series found on the supposed
order of time in the events narrated—beginning with the intel-marriage
of Uranus aud Gaea, and the Theogony—and concluding with the death
of Odysseus by the hands of his son Telegonus. Tltis cocleam passed
by tlte name os tlte Epic Cydan and che poels, whose composition were em-

to explain the disparaging sentiment connected by Horace with the
idea of a Cyclic writer.”—139. Parturlunt nonies, etc. From the

poet’s metaphor in the first instance may be taken from brilliant fire-
works or from a single rocket; in the second, from the kindling of a
fire. But he means, of course: nota brilliant opening, which falls off
into a dull and worthless pieoe, but a simple, modest introductioni,
