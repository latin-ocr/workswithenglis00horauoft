each of these eight months the tuition was carried. This is the expia}

In magu nt populo. The ut is elliptical, and, referring to vestem
servosque sequentes, is equal to ut fleri solet, or ut expectare potest—Ut hu
sometimes in similar constructions a limiting force (which 1 have illus·
trated in note on Livy i., 57), but, I think, not here. A very full view
of this use of ut, Kuhner has given in his edit. of Tusc. Quaestt„ 1, 8,

school under the care of a slave, who also carried his books, etc. The
regular name of this slave was paedagogus, παιδαγωγὸς. St. Paul makes
a fine metaphorical use of this custom in Galatiam iii. 24: 'nu law

says, in grateful praise of his worthy father, that he was himself his
son⁷s paedagogus. — 86. conatu. Collector. See Life of Horace. —-

pounded of two Celtic words—petar, four; and rit, wheeL—See niet.

sense of vilis, exigui pretii. — 109. manu, means a vessel for

tion, and seems better than that which makes millibus—aliis mascu-

The Circus Maximus, between the Palatine and the Aventine‚ in which
were exhibited the great Roman Games, and capable of accommodathg,
at the lowest estimato, 150‚000 persons. As it was a place of great extent,
close by the Forum, in the heart of the city, about it would naturally
gather, even when no games were going on, fortune-uellere, pickpockets,
and all the classes of rogues that infest a great city. Hence the epithet
Fallat-vn, cheating. ——Vespertlnum3 the Forum, being the great pub-
lic plaee, was towards evening filled with groups of citizens, who met
there, when business was over, to talk over the news, and the affairs of

the day. -—1u. 11111118, sowune-teuers.-—116· lapis sibun i. e. a
