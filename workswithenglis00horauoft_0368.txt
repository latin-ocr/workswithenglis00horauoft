ODE IX.

To enter into the spirit os this ode, we must summon before us the occasion which
probably suggested it. We may fancy the poet, with some os his frienth melining on
the festive couch. lt is a stem winter’s day. The Tiber has etopped in 2⁸1⁸ course, the
woods bend under the weight os the snow, and Mt. Soracte (perhaps visible from the
Triennium), capped with ice, glitters in the distance. The thoughts and conversation os
the guesoe, chiHed, as it were, by the wintry scene without, have taken a gloomy turn,
when Horace, addressing the Thaliarehus, or master os the feast, bids his friends turn
their thoughts rather to the cheersul scene before them, thanksully to enjoy the bleaeings
within their reach, and leave the rest to the wise disposal os the gods.

This view of the ode, first proposed, 1 believe, by Dillenburger‚ 1 prefer to the ordina-
ry one which makes Thaliarchus a proper name, used by the poet, in addressing one of
his friends.

1. candidum. See n. O. i.‚ 4‚·4.—2.‚ Soracte.. A mountain, about
2000 feet high, to the north of Rome, and distant nearly 25 miles. The
modern name is Monte di Sanco Sibvestro‚ or, as it is sometimes called,

San Oreste. 3. Silvae laborantes· Osborne aptly compares, stom

4. constIterlnt3 from consistere, to stand παλ· have stopped in their
course, i. e. from sreezing. These images of winter would never be
used by a modern poet, of any place in southern Italy3 and it is well
known that the climate of Italy is much milder than it was in the time
of Horace. Such quantities of suow as are here described are now
never seen in the vicinity of Rome; in the streets of the city it seldom
remains more than a day or two; and ‘⁸ ice in the Tiber is now as un-
known a phenomenon as it would be between the tropics.” (Bunsen‚
quoted by Dr. Amold in Hist. c. xxiii.) The change of climate is gen-
erally ascribed to the selling of the woods and forests, and the conse-
quent diminution of water in the low grounds in the country, and to the
clearing and cultivation of the soil—See, on this point, Dr. Arnold, as
above cited3 also Hume’s Essay on the Populousness of Ancient Na-
tions; and Gibbon’s Decline, ete, ch. ix„ and-Miscell. Works, vol. iii„

describes a sort of geme of forfeits. A girl hides herself, but betrays
the place of concealment by a loud laugh, and loses the bracclet or
ring, which is the forfeit. Dillenburger points to the select order of th‘e
words m lines 21, 225 the three pairs of words, bacculis puellae, moditor
