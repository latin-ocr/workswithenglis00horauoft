the lecms summus, and last5 the lectus imus. On the² loom nediu, flio
highest place, therefore the highest at the table, was the first on the
right (as you face the table), then respectively the middle and the
third place 3 on the lectus summus, which stood to the left of then-edan,
the first place was the one farthest from the lechas medius, then the
other two places in orderss on the lectus imus, the first place was the
one nearest the lectus medina and then the other two respectively. The
guests reclined, each on his left arm, so that those on the imus and
those on the summus were turned in opposite directions, the latter look-
ing towards the medius, the former looking away stom it. This amn-
mary I have made up stom Becker's Gallus, Exc. ii. to'Sc. ix„ where is
given the fullest and most satisfactory account of the snb-ieet, with
*which I am acquainted. The account given in Dict. Antiqq. is different,
and⁷ I think, unsatisfactory. The following sketch, taken stom orem,
illustrates the Triclinium in general, and the arrangement of the gum,
as described in the present passage:
