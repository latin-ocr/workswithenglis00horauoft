i. e. there must always be only three actors. Aster the introductioni,
by Sophocles, of a third actor, the number of actore in the Greek tra-
gedies was always three. There might be more persons upon the stage,
but only three took part in the dialogue. The actors were called, stom

ducas ⁰f tJoe wagio chorus, in accordance with the practice of the Greek
tragic writers. These duties were two: 1, to take tloe part of an ador
(actoris—defendat). This was done through the medium of the cory-

 

phaeus, or leader of the chorus, who ascended the Thymele (which
was in the middle of the orchestra, and was the central point of all
the movements of the chorus), and from this place joined in the dia-
logue with the actors on the stage3 2, to sing songs between tae ads

The chorus, the lyric element of the Greek Tragedy, was no less es-
sential to it than the dialogue or dramatic element. Indeed the chorus
was the early and original element. The origin of the Greek Tragedy
is found in the solemn dithyrambic odes, descriptiva ot* the sufferiugs
of Dionysus or Bacchus, which were sung at the Attic festivals, held in
honor of that deity, and called the Dionysia. In process of time, the
songs described other subJects than the adventures of Bacchus ; actor-s
were introduced, distinct from the chorus, the parts given to the actore

constituted the dialogue, and thus was gradually developed the form os ’

the regular Attio Tragedy.—Comp. belOW, notes on l. 276, and l. 279.—
