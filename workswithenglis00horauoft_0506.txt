The palla had the same place in the dress of Roman women,
as the toga in the dress of the men. It was always worn ont

SATIRE IX.

This Satin-e is directed against a class os persons, who were doubtlen extremely sn-
noying to Horace and his literary friends. These were empty pretenders to the unm,
end honors of a berary man3 persons who, without any real merit, saneied themselves
men os taste and wit, poets and scholars3 and who, bent upon getting into notice, snstened
themselves upon all who had any influence, and, with the importunity os vulgar natm-es,
besought an introduction to the society of the great. Puffed up with asense of their
own importance, and inflamed with the success of a virgil andanem, whom'they
regarded only as savorites os fortune, they imagined that they themselves needed only ι
tittle friendly aid, a mere lucky stat-t: to secure them sor ever an established placa in the
circle os Maecenas and his friends.

ln writing this fine piece os satire, which professes to be a description os a essue! sd-
venture with one of these importunam pretenders, it was doubtless the aim and hope of

nomes ω rid himself once sor all os the whole odious tribe.
