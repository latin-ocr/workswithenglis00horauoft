tho relative proportione or the two elementa of the drama, viz„ tho
choruses and the recitations, by abridging the former, and expanding
the latter into a regular plot. He also improved the theatrical apparat-
tus, by furnishing the actors with the cothurnus (see n. Ο. ii„ 1, 11), and
with better and more various masks and dresses. In what respect he
modifled sor the better the construction of the stage, we are not in-
formed5 as the words modicis-tignis can hardly refer to the stage of the
new stone theatro, the building of which was commenced' soon asserhis
first appearance. (See Dict. Antiqq„ under Theatrum.) The fall of the
old wooden fabric on the occasion of Aesehylus’s first representation,
tud the consequent erection of the magnificent theatre on the S. E.
descent of the Acropolis, may be regarded as emblematic of the for-
tunes of Attic Tragedy before and aster the time of Aeschylus ·—

of which Aristophanes was the master, flourished from 458-404. Its
chief characteristic, to which Horace here alludes, was the unbounded
steedom with which it satirized distinguished Athenian citizens, poets,
philosophas, statesmen, and the parties and measures, politian, social,
literary, with which such citizens were associated. The Middle Comedy
mcceeded the Old, and continued to n. c. 340. It was less personal,
and satirIzed classes rather than individuals, or is it satirized indi-
vidum, represented them under fictitious names. The New Come-dy
continued from Β. c. 340 to ec. 260. This was like the comedy of
modern times; it aimed at an imitation of ordinary life, and its subjects
and characters were alike fictitious. — 283. Lex est aeoepta. A law
restrictive of the freedom of comedy was passed ac. 440; a similar
ono, forbidding the ridicule of persons by name was passed B. c. 415.
The political changes of the times were directly felt by the Old Come
dy3 political freedom was essential to its being and life; and accord-
ingly it flourished and fell, along with Athenian democracy. ——284·
