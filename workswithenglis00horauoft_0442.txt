ODE XXIX

This char-ming ode the poet, from his Sabine sarm, writes to Maecenas, begging him ω
hasten away from the noise and smoke os the city, and sorget sora while the camos
state, amid the simple pleasures os rural life. He bids him remember that we must live
wisely and well in the present, as the future is all uncertain, an is hidden from mona!
view. He who is content with what is given him, and who carnes within him a bravo
and scarless conscience‚-that man is independent os all the changes of fortune.

θ. Nee semper—contempleris. With Dillenb. I give the preference to
this reading, which is sustained by good MS. authority, The other
reading, m—contempleris‚ though a good MS. reading, and yielding, in
general, the same sense as owe—contempleris, is yet inferior on amount
of the abruptness of the transition, which it requires, in passing from
the preceding line; whereas πρῖε-πει παπ joins directly the two clauses,
contempleris having an imperative force3 match thysels from delay, and

palace on the Esquiline, surveying with wistful gaze the charming pros·
peet before him,-—those delightful hills that skirt the plain on the east,
and those attractive spots, Tibur, Aesula, and Tasculum3 longing ὶδι-
the quiet delights of rural lise, 'and yet fastened to the city by public
cares. ΤΙιθ conjectural reading, ut semper udum, besides being ,iejtme
and prosaic, is quite gratuitous‚ being founded in a wrong apprehension
of the word contemplari; as if it could apply only to objecta quite near
at hand. The mere mention (made by Orelli and Dillenbfirger) of such
Latin expressions as contemplari asbra, stellas, coelum, is sufficient 'to do
away with such a view of this verb. Tusculum was about twelve, and
Tibur sixteen miles from Rome, and always visible in clear westher
from the high parts of the city. —60 Tibur. See Ο. i., 7, 12. Aesula

other fine residence at Tibur, called by Suetonius (Nero. 88), umis
