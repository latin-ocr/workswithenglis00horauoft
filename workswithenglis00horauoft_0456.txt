ODE VII.

An ode, occasioned, like the Fourth os Book First, by the return os Spring. ‘l'here
too the poet dweus upon the thoughts suggested by the season; and compares the chang-
ing year with the lise os man. In each alike, time ever hurries on3 but of the yses,
though it is always passing, there is always renewal, in the regular remmus the mmm.
Not so in human lise ; it has but one spring, one Summer; and its wimer-ones ἰι-σᾶ,
the whole is closed sor ever. '

‘⁴ And pale concluding winter comes at last,
And shuts the scene.”—Tnoxsou.

It is not certain who is the Torquatus, to whom the poet addressed this ode, ns well u
the Fisth Epistle os the First Book. Some suppose it to be the grandson, other- ths mn
os L. Manlius Torquatus, in whose consulship Horace was born. But os the grand-on
we know nothing with any certainty, and os the son, we know, from Cieem’s Bruta, e.
76, that he died in Spain many years before this ode was written.
