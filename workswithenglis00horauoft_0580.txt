536 nome οη THE Emeum.

nium on account of this difficulty, Horace advises the dramatic treat-
ment of (e. g.) the materials furnished by the Iliad.

2. By another interpretation, communia is explained as :nondum
occupata, a nemine adhuc tractata, i. e. things never before handled, in
short, new subJects; and proprie means in a peculim· or original mawner.
The sense of the whole passage, which is given by this interpretation,
is kindred t'o that which is stated above. But the method seems objec-
tionable, because communia can mean untried or new subjecte, only by
way of inference: as thus: communia (it is said) means what is eom-
mon and open alike to all authors, just as the civil law calls the sea, the
air, &c communia, common to a110men3 now subjecta, which axe new,
hitherto untried, are common to all writers3 and accordingly, nomn-amia
means here new, untried subjects. It is clear that this method of inter·
pretation is not a legitimate one.

3. The third interpretation, while it takes the same view of proprie
as No. 2, takes an exactly opposite one of communia, and makes
that = jam occupata et nota, i. e. things osten handled and well known,
in short, old subjecta The sense of the whole passage, given by this
interpretation is this: it is difficult to handle common subjects in an
original manner, and yet you had better do this, by dramatizing the
Iliad, than be the first to handle new subJects. The obvious objection
here is, that there is no such link in the original between the two parts
of the passage as is expressed by and yet. The Editors, who interpret
thus, translate tuque by and ‘yet you; just as if Horace had written
“ tu tamen,'’ “ nihilominus tu '² (Orelli). Indeeda Latin paraphrase of
Vincentius Gaudius (quoted by a celebrated Editor from the British
Critic, Vol. 5, p. 356, and adopted by him) has these words: “hune
tamen ego conatum tibi suadeo.” Of this whole interpretation, it seems
enough to say, that in order to establish it, it must be clearly made out
that the que in tuque is equivalent to tamen. —— 181. For the course of
thought, see above, n. on 119-135. Publica3 opposed to privati'jmis,
and :publici juris, of common right; said of something, which is
open to the use of all alike. In using the word materies, Horace had in
mind the store of myths and fables furnished by Homer, and by earlier
and later writers. From these stores the Greek tragie writers drew
their subjects, and they made these subjects their own by treating them
in their own manner. For instance, the Electra (cited by Orelli) was a
subject on which Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides each composed a
tragedy. These same stores were still open to the Roman poets; and
hence for their guidance these precepts of Horace. But the sam‘e word
may also be applied by us to similar stores of fiction (e. g. ballads) or
of history, treasured up in the literature of any medem people. So ⁹
too familiar instances of the original treatment of the materials of tra-
dition and fiction are furnished by such plays as Shakspeare’s Hamlet,
