eso—2⁵⁰. From the regular 'rragedy Horace now posses ω Hoe satyrio
drama, or Satyr-play, mentioning tlte ‘reason sor its introductio„ (222-
224), and prescribing the rules sor its conduct (225-250). It was the pe-
culiarity of the Satyric drama, that it combined with the materiale and
characters of the regular Tragedy a chorus of Satyrs. Its invention
belongs to Pratinas, a contemporary of Aeschylus3 aster-warde, during
the golden period of Attio tragedy‚ illustrated by Aeschylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides, it was a constituent part of the dramatic exhibitions,
forming an after-pieee to the trilogies or series of three tragedies which
were always brought out at the Dionysia by those celebrated tmgie
composers. ·This conjunction of the mlogvy with a satyr-play was ·
called a tetralogus, — 220. Πίηιιιις hence the name of tragedy‚

(τραγῳδία, τράγος and ᾠδή) gaab—song5 either because (88 here) a goat ·

was the prize‚ or because a goat was sacrifieed ou the altar round which
the chorus sang3 or tlae song of the goats or Satyrs, as the Satyrs were
called τράγοι, from their goat-like appearance (see n. Ο. ii„ 19, 4). —
221. Aspen may be translated as an adv.; παίει-ης in allusion to the
rustic satyrs. -222. Gravitate3 i. e. of tragedy‚ of its gods and
heroes; literally dignity being unimpaired, without loss of dignaq—
Eo, qnod, etc. It thus appears, that the satyr-play, like a modern
faroe or after-piece‚ was intended to divert and amuse the people. —
225. lta risores, etc. From what has been said above, it appears
that this Satyric drama was partly tragic, as it represented gods and
heroes in its dialogue, and partly comic, as it had a chorus of Satyrs.
Now the rule of Horace for such a play, in respect to its characters
(227-233), its diction (234-243), and the language ⁰s tlte Satyrs (244-
250), is substantially this: that ic preserve a due medium Μυκη tragedy
and cmnedy, neither rising to tlte loflier tone ⁰s tlte one, nor siuking to the
lower tone of tlte otker. — 22¹1. Ne· J oined with the' preceding ita, this
word seems to denote result, mat—mc, and to be used for ut non. --
228. Nuper3 need not be taken in the limited sense of lady, as if the
line referred to the very same personages who had appeared in a
tragedy just before acted, because the pieces of a trilogy had different
plots and character; but at some former timae: the sense is, as Orelli
gives it, thus: “iidem dii atque heroes. qui, in tragoediis saepe con-
specti, notissimi nobis sunt.²’—- 232. [It-matrona} j0in with tragoedia,
which is the subject of intererit. The poet aptly illustrates the bearing
of Tragedy in the Satyr-play by the image of a matron, j0ining‚ with-
out loss of dignity‚ in the festive dance. —224. Ῑιοηιῐις “ut pura,
